\abstract{This report delves into the Amazon Books Review dataset using data science techniques. 
Our goal was to uncover insights, sentiments, and correlations within this extensive collection of reviews. 
Leveraging tools like Hadoop, Spark, MongoDB, and Python libraries, we explored factors influencing review helpfulness,
including review length, sentiment, and ratings. We also ventured into helpfulness prediction with Word2Vec and machine 
learning, training and evaluating different models like Random Forest, Support Vector Regressor and Multi Layer Perceptron Regressor.
This report underscores the power of data science in understanding book reviews, 
emphasizing data-driven decision-making and discovering hidden patterns in data.}
