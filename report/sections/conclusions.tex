\section{Conclusion}

In summary, this study delves into the intricacies of online book reviews and reveals essential insights for 
understanding user preferences and review system dynamics. The research highlights the critical importance of 
scalable data analysis systems to efficiently deal with a Big Data context, and the delicate balance between review length and sentiment. Users tend to favor 
longer reviews, though excessive length can diminish their impact. The double investigation on positive reviews, based both on
rating and on the number of positive words in a review, shows that the latter is found the more useful the more positive it is.
 Surprisingly, user ratings 
appear to be objective, providing reliable book evaluations.
Additionally, the study challenges the assumption that publisher experience directly correlates with user 
appreciation, showing no correlation between the publisher size and its books average ratings.
The results of the prediction model are promising, showing a RMSE ~ 0.16 but there is still room for improvement.
Future work should focus on feature engineering to further enhance prediction systems.
