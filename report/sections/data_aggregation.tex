\subsection*{Data Aggregation}

The MapReduce job performs an inner join operation between the "Data table" and the "Rating table" based on the book title,
resulting in a single file containing the joined records from both tables.

\subsubsection*{Mapper}

The Mapper script processes input data line by line, converting each line into a key-value structure.
The key represents the book title, and the value contains the remaining line content.
To distinguish between records from the 'Data table' and 'Rating table'
and ensure the correct processing order in the Reducer phase, the Mapper appends
a special character ('-' for 'Data table' and 'www' for 'Rating table') as the second key element.
This ensures that 'Data table' records are processed before 'Rating table' records during subsequent MapReduce phases.

\subsubsection*{Reducer}

The Reducer script processes intermediate output records generated by the Mapper,
aiming to join 'Data' and 'Rating' records for the same title.
The Reducer reads records sequentially, storing 'Data' and 'Rating' information separately.
When both 'Data' and 'Rating' records for the same title are available,
the Reducer performs the join operation by combining the data from these records.
