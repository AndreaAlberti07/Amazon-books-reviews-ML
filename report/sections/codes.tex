%% Complex MongoDB query to answer: In which categories are the best publishers focused?

\section{Complex MongoDB query}

A MongoDB query is designed to identify the categories that top publishers prioritize.
It achieves this by filtering out records with missing or zero review scores,
as well as those without publisher and category information.
The query then calculates the average rating for each combination of category and publisher. \\
Next, it groups the results by category, gathering average scores and review counts for each publisher
within that category. The query also expands the list of categories and eliminates categories or
publishers with review counts below a specified threshold.\\
Further analysis involves counting the number of categories where the average rating exceeds 4.5 for each publisher.
The results are aggregated by category, and the total count is assessed. Finally, the query sorts the outcomes
in descending order of the total count.\\
The python code that performs this query can be found at this  \href{https://github.com/DavideLigari01/data-science-project/blob/main/notebooks/hypotesis_testing/hypothesis_6.ipynb}{link}.
