\section{Discovery}
To begin our data science campaign was crucial to compose the team, clearly fix our goal and exploring about the available resources.

\subsection{Team}
The team is composed by three members:

\noindent
\textit{Andrea Alberti}: \href{https://github.com/AndreaAlberti07}{github.com/AndreaAlberti07}\\
\textit{Davide Ligari}: \href{https://github.com/DavideLigari01}{github.com/DavideLigari01}\\
\textit{Cristian Andreoli}: \href{https://github.com/CristianAndreoli94}{github.com/CristianAndreoli94}\\
    
\subsection{Framing}
The \textbf{goal} of the project is to develop a \textbf{scalable} solution to analyze a dataset of reviews of books from Amazon and
eventually build a model able to predict the helpfulness of a review based on its content.

\subsection{Tools}
The tools were chosen with the aim of developing a scalable solution, able to work in a \textbf{Big Data} environment.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Virtual Machine}: to work in a controlled environment.
    \item \textbf{Hadoop}: to store data in a distributed file system and to perform MapReduce operation on it.
    \item \textbf{Spark}: used as an improved alternative to MapReduce, to perform operations on the distributed dataset.
    \item \textbf{Python}: as the reference programming language thanks to its libraries.
    \item \textbf{MongoDB}: used as NoSQL database sandbox to safely work with local data.
    \item \textbf{GitHub}: to share and collaborate on the project.
    \item \textbf{LaTeX}: to write the report.
\end{itemize}
