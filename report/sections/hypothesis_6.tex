\subsection*{Hypothesis 6}

\textbf{H0 (Null Hypothesis):} There is no correlation between the number of books published for a category (or publisher) and the review score.\\
All data cleaning and transformation steps were executed using MongoDB's aggregation pipeline to ensure efficient and rapid computation.
To reduce bias, we excluded categories with fewer than 50 books and publishers with fewer than 20 books.
The results are presented in Table \ref{tab:h6_correlations}.\\
\textbf{Conclusion:} The hypotheses are rejected as the metrics reveal no significant correlation between the number of books published
for a category (or publisher) and the review score in both cases. These results surprises us as we expected the more important publishers
to perform a more meticulous selection of the books to publish, thus leading to a higher average score.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Curiosity:}
We executed two complex MongoDB queries to answer two intriguing questions:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Which are the best publishers?} (i.e., those capable of achieving average scores above 4.5 in multiple categories)
    \item \textbf{In which categories are the best publishers focused?}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The results of these queries are presented in Figure \ref{fig:h6_which_best} and Figure \ref{fig:h6_where_best}.
