\firstword{I}{n}
In the age of digital commerce, customer reviews profoundly impact product perception and purchase decisions.
Amazon, with its extensive repository of book reviews spanning nearly two decades, holds a wealth of valuable insights,
sentiments, and trends. This project aims to create a scalable solution for uncovering patterns, sentiment trends,
and correlations within the realm of book reviews, utilizing advanced tools and technologies like Hadoop,
Spark, MongoDB, and Python libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn.
In this report, we provide a detailed exploration of our project, covering stages from initial data discovery
and preparation to feature extraction, model building, and evaluation.
