His nonsense verse, like that of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear, has changed language itself, giving us new words like ""nerd.""

"Herb Caen	"Herb Caen, a popular columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle, recently quoted a Voice of America press release as saying that it was reorganizing in order to ""eliminate duplication and redundancy. "" This quote both states a goal of data compression and illustrates its common need: the removal of duplication (or redundancy) can provide a more efficient representation of data and the quoted phrase is itself a candidate for such surgery. Not only can the number of words in the quote be reduced without losing informa tion, but the statement would actually be enhanced by such compression since it will no longer exemplify the wrong that the policy is supposed to correct. Here compression can streamline the phrase and minimize the em barassment while improving the English style. Compression in general is intended to provide efficient representations of data while preserving the essential information contained in the data. This book is devoted to the theory and practice of signal compression, i. e. , data compression applied to signals such as speech, audio, images, and video signals (excluding other data types such as financial data or general purpose computer data). The emphasis is on the conversion of analog waveforms into efficient digital representations and on the compression of digital information into the fewest possible bits. Both operations should yield the highest possible reconstruction fidelity subject to constraints on the bit rate and implementation complexity.","['Allen Gersho', 'Robert M.

"A striking collection of presidential portraits from the National Portrait Gallery	"A striking collection of presidential portraits from the National Portrait Gallery, this volume encapsulates the spirit of the most powerful office in the world. America's Presidents showcases the nation's largest collection of portraits of all the presidents beyond the White House's own, capturing the permanent exhibition that lies at the heart of the Portrait Gallery's mission to tell the American story through the individuals who have shaped it. The book explores presidential imagery through portraits ranging from the traditional, such as the iconic and newly restored ""Lansdowne"" portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart, to the contemporary, such as Elaine de Kooning's colorful depiction of John F. Kennedy. Many of the featured portraits reveal much about the sitter, such as the intimate rendering of an informal George W. Bush by Robert Anderson and the fanciful, mosaic-like Chuck Close image of Bill Clinton. Some tell us more about the artist, such as the likeness of Franklin Delano Roosevelt that Douglas Chandor planned to include in a larger work about peace that would commemorate Roosevelt's Yalta meeting with wartime Allied leaders Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. Works in other media, including sculptures and daguerreotypes, round out the presidential collection. Lively narratives accompany each piece, exploring the president's background and biography as well as the work's artistic and historical significance. Taken together, the portraits are a powerful visual exploration of the history of the highest office in the land and the diverse men who have held it.",['National Portrait Gallery'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lRVHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=lRVHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Portraits+of+the+Presidents:+The+National+Portrait+Gallery&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Smithsonian Institution,2018-02-13,http://books.google.nl/books?id=lRVHDwAAQBAJ&dq=Portraits+of+the+Presidents:+The+National+Portrait+Gallery&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],	R
"Twenty-five years ago	"Twenty-five years ago, at the height of the counter-culture movement, several hundred hippies drove their school buses into southern Tennessee and founded America's largest, modern-day intentional community, The Farm. In its heyday, the community was home to over 1,200 optimistic young people and the young-at-heart. Their purpose for coming together was to experiment with alternative lifestyles that could help raise the standard of living for impoverished people around the world while conserving the planet's resources. The results of these experiments were not always predictable, but were always interesting, and created lasting bonds among community members that are still strong today. The Farm remains a vibrant, working environment for change. Why has it lasted so long?

"The Bismarck is perhaps the most famous – and notorious – warship ever built. Completed in 1941	"The Bismarck is perhaps the most famous – and notorious – warship ever built. Completed in 1941, the 45,000-ton German battleship sank HMS Hood, the pride of the British Navy, during one of the most sensational encounters in naval history. Following the sinking, Bismarck was chased around the North Atlantic by many units of the Royal Navy. She was finally dispatched with gunfire and torpedoes on 27 May, less than five months after her completion. Her wreck still lies where she sank, 4,800m down and 960km off the west coast of France. Drawing on new research and technology, this edition is the most comprehensive examination of Bismarck ever published.

Certainly at no time for nearly a millenium and a half has the opportunity for genuine theology been greater, since the ground has been cleared in the remarkable way of the old dualist and atomistic modes of thought that have plagued theology for centuries. It is, therefore, up to us as theologians to develop theology on its own proper ground in this scientific context, if only because this is the kind of life and culture, and the kind of theology that can support the message of the Gospel to mankind, as, in touch with the advances of natural science, theology comes closer and closer to a real understanding of the creation as it came from the hand of God.",['Thomas F.

"Appointed by Pope John XXIII to the Pontifical Commission on Population	"Appointed by Pope John XXIII to the Pontifical Commission on Population, Family, and Birth, Fuchs ultimately found himself disappointed in his three years of service and spent the next thirty years exploring a broad array of issues pivotal to a reconstruction of Roman Catholic natural law theory. This is the first full-length analysis of Fuchs's efforts. Beginning historically by looking at Fuchs's writings and beliefs before the Pontifical Commission appointment, including his defense of natural law during the ""situation ethics"" debates of the 50s and 60s, the concept of personal salvation, and the status of ""nature"" and ""human nature,"" Graham moves to the intellectual conversion that inspired Fuchs to reconsider his concepts following the commission appointment. From there, Graham engages in a sustained critique of Fuchs's natural theory, addressing both the strengths and weaknesses to be found there and suggest possible avenues of development that would make a positive contribution to the ongoing quest to rehabilitate the Roman Catholic natural law theory that continues to dominate the landscape of moral theology today.",['Mark Graham'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t1KlgtaPokMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=t1KlgtaPokMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Josef+Fuchs+on+Natural+Law+(Moral+Traditions+series)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Georgetown University Press,2002-10-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t1KlgtaPokMC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],	R

"The study of Augustine's political teachings has suffered from a history of misreadings	"The study of Augustine's political teachings has suffered from a history of misreadings, both ancient and modern. It is only in recent years that the traditional lines of 'Augustinian pessimism' have been opened to question. Scholars have begun to explore the broader lines of Augustine's political thought in his letters and sermons, and thus have been able to place his classic text, The City of God, in its proper context. The essays in this volume take stock of these recent developments and revisit old assumptions about the significance of Augustine of Hippo for political thought. They do so from many different perspectives, examining the anthropological and theological underpinnings of Augustine's thought, his critique of politics, his development of his own political thought, and some of the later manifestations or uses of his thought in the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and today. This new vision is at once more bracing, more hopeful, and more diverse than earlier readings could have allowed.","['John Doody', 'Kim Paffenroth', 'Kevin L.

Negen gruwelijk verminkte lijken zijn er al gevonden: vijf in Ierland en vier in Amerika. Steeds wordt het lichaam gedumpt op een vuilnisbelt en steeds worden de ledematen afgesneden. Wie pleegt deze verschrikkelijke moorden? Wanneer een tiende lijk wordt gevonden, wordt patholoog-anatoom Kay Scarpetta opgeroepen om de zaak te onderzoeken. Alles lijkt erop dat een en dezelfde dader aan het werk is, maar is er echt sprake van dezelfde dader? Kay Scarpetta en rechercheur Pete Marino ontdekken steeds meer bewijsmateriaal dat wijst op een alomvattend complot, waardoor het gehele land in gevaar is...

"The sixth book in the Kay Scarpetta series	"The sixth book in the Kay Scarpetta series, from No. 1 bestselling author Patricia Cornwell. 'America's most chilling writer of crime fiction' The Times Christmas had never been a particularly good time for Dr Kay Scarpetta. Although a holiday for most, it always seem to heighten the alienation felt by society's violent fringe; and that usually means more work for Scarpetta, Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner. The body was naked, female and found propped against a fountain in a bleak area of New York's Central Park. Her apparent manner of death points to a modus operandi that is chillingly familiar: the gunshot wound to the head, the sections of skin excised from the body, the displayed corpse - all suggest that Temple Brooks Gault, Scarpetta's nemesis, is back at work. Calling on all her reserves of courage and skill, and the able assistance of colleagues Marino and Wesley, Scarpetta must track this most dangerous of killers in pursuit of survival as well as justice - heading inexorably to an electrifying climax amid the dark, menacing labyrinths of the New York subway.

"A “brilliant” look at America’s sixteenth president by the New York Times–bestselling	"A “brilliant” look at America’s sixteenth president by the New York Times–bestselling, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Lincoln (American Historical Review). First published in 1956 and revised and updated for the twenty-first century, Lincoln Reconsidered is a masterpiece of Civil War scholarship. In a dozen eloquent, witty, and incisive essays, the author of the definitive biography of Abraham Lincoln offers a fresh perspective on topics previously shrouded in myth and hagiography and brings the president’s tough-mindedness, strategic acumen, and political flexibility into sharp focus. From Lincoln’s patchwork education to his contradictory interpretations of the Constitution and the legacy of the Founding Fathers, David Herbert Donald reveals the legal mind behind the legend of the Great Emancipator. “Toward a Reconsideration of the Abolitionists” sheds new light on the radicalism of the antislavery movement, while “Herndon and Mary Lincoln” brilliantly characterizes the complicated relationship between two of the president’s closest companions. “Getting Right with Lincoln” and “The Folklore Lincoln” draw on the methods of cultural anthropology to produce a provocative analysis of Lincoln as symbol. No historian has done more to enhance our understanding of Lincoln’s presidency and the causes and effects of the Civil War than Donald. Lincoln Reconsidered is an entertaining and accessible introduction to his work and a must-read for every student of American history.",['David Herbert Donald'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FkN_CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=FkN_CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Lincoln+reconsidered%3B:+Essays+on+the+Civil+War+era&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2016-03-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FkN_CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],	R
"With over a million copies sold	"With over a million copies sold, Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory. A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day. Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",['Henry Hazlitt'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Economics+in+one+lesson&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Currency,2010-08-11,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],18.0	R

In this bold and timely critique	"The doctrine of ""Islamic economics"" entered debates over the social role of Islam in the mid-twentieth century. Since then it has pursued the goal of restructuring economies according to perceived Islamic teachings. Beyond its most visible practical achievement--the establishment of Islamic banks meant to avoid interest--it has promoted Islamic norms of economic behavior and founded redistribution systems modeled after early Islamic fiscal practices. In this bold and timely critique, Timur Kuran argues that the doctrine of Islamic economics is simplistic, incoherent, and largely irrelevant to present economic challenges. Observing that few Muslims take it seriously, he also finds that its practical applications have had no discernible effects on efficiency, growth, or poverty reduction. Why, then, has Islamic economics enjoyed any appeal at all? Kuran's answer is that the real purpose of Islamic economics has not been economic improvement but cultivation of a distinct Islamic identity to resist cultural globalization. The Islamic subeconomies that have sprung up across the Islamic world are commonly viewed as manifestations of Islamic economics. In reality, Kuran demonstrates, they emerged to meet the economic aspirations of socially marginalized groups. The Islamic enterprises that form these subeconomies provide advancement opportunities to the disadvantaged. By enhancing interpersonal trust, they also facilitate intragroup transactions. These findings raise the question of whether there exist links between Islam and economic performance. Exploring these links in relation to the long-unsettled question of why the Islamic world became underdeveloped, Kuran identifies several pertinent social mechanisms, some beneficial to economic development, others harmful.",['Timur Kuran'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VkIJGPNzVIIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=VkIJGPNzVIIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Islam+and+Mammon:+The+Economic+Predicaments+of+Islamism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Princeton University Press,2010-12-16,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VkIJGPNzVIIC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],	R

"Every plant has its own distinct spiritual energy or its own deva. Devas are the radiant light of the Universal Divine that permeates all things. Since the earliest times	"Every plant has its own distinct spiritual energy or its own deva. Devas are the radiant light of the Universal Divine that permeates all things. Since the earliest times, people were aware that all of Nature is divine. Great and wondrous myths were told that explained the presence of divine energy as it exists in thunder, in trees, and in sunlight. Some of this lore was the foundation of religions. But the simpler stories, such as those of a plant's energy, explored day-to-day matters like health and love. This understanding of the world has been preserved in folklore through poems, chants, ditties, and spells. From researching the history of folklore from cultures around the world, patterns emerge that enable us to approach the true nature of plants' devas. This compendium presents the lore and the corresponding usage for 330 magickal herbes. Great care was taken only to include folklore that was documented as authentic. You will meet many new herbes in this text and explore fascinating magickal and religi uses, but most of all, you will come to respect the divine that surrounds your everyday life.",['Paul Beyerl'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wA7xHAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=wA7xHAAACAAJ&dq=Compendium+of+Herbal+Magick&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Phoenix Publishing (WA),1998,http://books.google.nl/books?id=wA7xHAAACAAJ&dq=Compendium+of+Herbal+Magick&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Health & Fitness'],	R

"In the year 1833	"In the year 1833, two young brothers journey into the Wild West to seek their fortune; little do they know they’re embarking on the adventure of their lives. Expecting to stumble upon riches as they make their way westward, sixteen-year-old Dillon Griffith and his older brother Owen instead encounter hardship after hardship in the form of Indian raids, bloodthirsty villains, robbery, and kidnapping. With the help of a Shawnee trapper and scout, a runaway slave-turned–mountain man, and a beautiful American Indian warrior, the brothers battle the unexpected setbacks and obstacles that life in the West throws their way, and endeavor to find their place on the American frontier.Packed full of riveting action, gore, and vengeance, Deadville paints a thrilling—and historically pristine—picture of life in the Old West, from the physical environment to the social and economic milieus of frontier society. Jones’s famously meticulous research, inviting literary style, and suspenseful plot succeed in transporting readers to a time when lawlessness prevailed and buffalo roamed—when the belief in Manifest Destiny took America by storm and changed the country forever.",['Robert F.

Today, however, a great variety of mathematical methods is applied in biology and medicine. Practically every mathematical procedure that is useful in physics, chemistry, engineering, and economics has also found an important application in the life sciences. The past and present training of life scientists does by no means reflect this development. However, the impact ofthe fast growing number of applications of mathematical methods makes it indispensable that students in the life sciences are offered a basic training in mathematics, both on the undergraduate and the graduate level. This book is primarily designed as a textbook for an introductory course. Life scientists may also use it as a reference to find mathematical methods suitable to their research problems. Moreover, the book should be appropriate for self-teaching. It will also be a guide for teachers.

On author Philip José Farmer’s Riverworld, humans from every era and culture have been simultaneously resurrected. Ancient Hebrews, medieval warriors, Spanish Inquisitors, and modern Americans intermingle in this strange new environment, but many still cling to old prejudices. Tom Mix, a silent-film star originally from early-twentieth-century Earth, is journeying among the vast population along the millions of miles of the River, in search of familiar faces from his own time. He’s been traveling the River for five years and believes people are starting to change. But when he’s entangled in a brutal clash between states, he discovers that some are slow to let go of the ideas that ruled them on Earth. This volume includes the novelette “Riverworld,” along with two additional Riverworld tales and ten other short stories, all strange, clever, and profound. Farmer’s explorations of the wonderful and bizarre—from a portrayal of Jesus and Satan as cowpokes to a reimagining of Edgar Rice Burroughs’s Tarzan in the style of William Burroughs—plunge the reader into “one of the most imaginative worlds in science fiction” (Booklist). This ebook includes“Riverworld,” “J.

"The sculpture of Auguste Rodin has become such an important part of our visual culture that it seems to have been with us always.

The universal appeal of Rodin's work springs from its emotional expressiveness, its astonishingly lifelike vitality, and its passionate mirroring of the human condition. With his impressionistic technique, supported by a complete mastery of anatomical structure, Rodin overthrew the reigning academic precepts of finish and symmetry. By developing subjects beyond traditional allegories, he pointed the way to sheer abstraction in the twentieth century. This handsomely illustrated catalogue publishes for the first time in its entirety a major American collection of sculpture, the Cantor gifts to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and provides a rich context for Rodin's own work. It presents sculpture by Rodin's most important nineteenth-century forerunners--Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, François Rude, and others--as well as work by the contemporaries he admired, those with whom he competed, those he influenced, and those who moved from his orbit to develop their own styles at the dawn of the twentieth century. But the centerpiece of the book remains Rodin: forty-two works by the most influential sculptor of the modern period, all specially photographed and many shown in multiple views. -- Publisher description.","['Los Angeles County Museum of Art', 'Mary L.

"""I had an obsession with the Amish. Plan and simple. Objectively it made no sense. I	"""I had an obsession with the Amish. Plan and simple. Objectively it made no sense. I, who worked hard at being special, fell in love with a people who valued being ordinary."" So begins Sue Bender's story, the captivating and inspiring true story of a harried urban Californian moved by the beauty of a display of quilts to seek out and live with the Amish. Discovering lives shaped by unfamiliar yet comforting ideas about time, work, and community, Bender is gently coaxed to consider, ""Is there another way to lead a good life?"" Her journey begins in a New York men's clothing store. There she is spellbound by the vibrant colors and stunning geometric simplicity of the Amish quilts ""spoke directly to me,"" writes Bender. Somehow, ""they went straight to my heart."" Heeding a persistent inner voice, Bender searches for Amish families willing to allow her to visit and share in there daily lives. Plain and Simple vividly recounts sojourns with two Amish families, visits during which Bender enters a world without television, telephone, electric light, or refrigerators; a world where clutter and hurry are replaced with inner quiet and calm ritual; a world where a sunny kitchen ""glows"" and ""no distinction was made between the sacred and the everyday."" In nine interrelated chapters--as simple and elegant as a classic nine-patch Amish quilt--Bender shares the quiet power she found reflected in lives of joyful simplicity, humanity, and clarity. The fast-paced, opinionated, often frazzled Bender returns home and reworks her ""crazy-quilt"" life, integrating the soul-soothing qualities she has observed in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns formed by the distinctive ""patches"" of her own life.

The conversations collected here (between 1860 and 1865) range from brief remarks to extended discussions. Mr. Segal introduces each interview and the personalities involved. The collection is arranged chronologically, giving a rich picture of the Lincoln presidency. Charles M. Segal was born in Montreal, attended college there, and served in the Royal Canadian Air Force. He holds degrees from Skidmore College and Union College. After World War II, he became a reporter and a foreign correspondent for a number of papers in Canada and the United States.

 Articles	 Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","Thomas Paine was the impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, and this volume brings together his best-known works: Common Sense, The American Crisis, Rights of Man, The Age of Reason, along with a selection of letters, articles and pamphlets that emphasizes Paine's American years. “I know not whether any man in the world,” wrote John Adams in 1805, “has had more influence on its inhabitants or affairs for the last thirty years than Tom Paine.” The impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, Paine wrote for his mass audience with vigor, clarity, and “common sense.” This Library of America volume is the first major new edition of his work in 50 years, and the most comprehensive single-volume collection of his writings available. Paine came to America in 1774 at age 37 after a life of obscurity and failure in England. Within fourteen months he published Common Sense, the most influential pamphlet for the American Revolution, and began a career that would see him prosecuted in England, imprisoned and nearly executed in France, and hailed and reviled in the American nation he helped create. In Common Sense, Paine set forth an inspiring vision of an independent America as an asylum for freedom and an example of popular self-government in a world oppressed by despotism and hereditary privilege. The American Crisis, begun during “the times that try men’s souls” in 1776, is a masterpiece of popular pamphleteering in which Paine vividly reports current developments, taunts and ridicules British adversaries, and enjoins his readers to remember the immense stakes of their struggle. Among the many other items included in the volume are the combative “Forester” letters, written in a reply to a Tory critic of Common Sense, and several pieces concerning the French Revolution, including an incisive argument against executing Louis XVI. Rights of Man (1791–1792), written in response to Edmund Burke’s attacks on the French Revolution, is a bold vision of an egalitarian society founded on natural rights and unbound by tradition. Paine’s detailed proposal for government assistance to the poor inspired generations of subsequent radicals and reformers. The Age of Reason (1794–1795), Paine’s most controversial work, is an unrestrained assault on the authority of the Bible and a fervent defense of the benevolent God of deism. Included in this volume are a detailed chronology of Paine’s life, informative notes, an essay on the complex printing history of Paine’s work, and an index. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.",['Thomas Paine'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2sS8qQBJBaoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2sS8qQBJBaoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Thomas+Paine+:+Collected+Writings+:+Common+Sense+/+The+Crisis+/+Rights+of+Man+/+The+Age+of+Reason+/+Pamphlets,+Articles,+and+Letters+(Library+of+America)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Library of America,1995-03-01,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2sS8qQBJBaoC&dq=Thomas+Paine+:+Collected+Writings+:+Common+Sense+/+The+Crisis+/+Rights+of+Man+/+The+Age+of+Reason+/+Pamphlets,+Articles,+and+Letters+(Library+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['History'],8.0	R

"Howard Zinn began work on his first book for his friends at Seven Stories Press in 1996	"Howard Zinn began work on his first book for his friends at Seven Stories Press in 1996, a big volume collecting all his shorter writings organized by subject. The themes he chose reflected his lifelong concerns: war, history, law, class, means and ends, and race. Throughout his life Zinn had returned again and again to these subjects, continually probing and questioning yet rarely reversing his convictions or the vision that informed them. The result was The Zinn Reader. Five years later, starting with Howard Zinn on History, updated editions of sections of that mammoth tome were published in inexpensive stand-alone editions. This second edition of Howard Zinn on History brings together twenty-seven short writings on activism, electoral politics, the Holocaust, Marxism, the Iraq War, and the role of the historian, as well as portraits of Eugene Debs, John Reed, and Jack London, effectively showing how Zinn’s approach to history evolved over nearly half a century, and at the same time sharing his fundamental thinking that social movements—people getting together for peace and social justice—can change the course of history. That core belief never changed. Chosen by Zinn himself as the shorter writings on history he believed to have enduring value—originally appearing in newspapers like the Boston Globe or the New York Times; in magazines like Z, the New Left, the Progressive, or the Nation; or in his book Failure to Quit—these essays appear here as examples of the kind of passionate engagement he believed all historians, and indeed all citizens of whatever profession, need to have, standing in sharp contrast to the notion of ""objective"" or ""neutral"" history espoused by some. ""It is time that we scholars begin to earn our keep in this world,"" he writes in ""The Uses of Scholarship."" And in ""Freedom Schools,"" about his experiences teaching in Mississippi during the remarkable ""Freedom Summer"" of 1964, he adds: ""Education can, and should, be dangerous.""",['Howard Zinn'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iGBOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=iGBOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Howard+Zinn+on+History&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Seven Stories Press,2011-06-14,http://books.google.nl/books?id=iGBOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Howard+Zinn+on+History&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],	R

Suitable as both a text and reference, its nine chapters first provide a brief history, fundamental definitions, and underlying philosophies, and then detail the goal programming variants and define them algebraically. Chapter 3 details the step-by-step formulation of the basic goal programming model, and Chapter 4 explores more advanced modeling issues and highlights some recently proposed extensions. Chapter 5 then details the solution methodologies of goal programming, concentrating on computerized solution by the Excel Solver and LINGO packages for each of the three main variants, and includes a discussion of the viability of the use of specialized goal programming packages. Chapter 6 discusses the linkages between Pareto Efficiency and goal programming. Chapters 3 to 6 are supported by a set of ten exercises, and an Excel spreadsheet giving the basic solution of each example is available at an accompanying website. Chapter 7 details the current state of the art in terms of the integration of goal programming with other techniques, and the text concludes with two case studies which were chosen to demonstrate the application of goal programming in practice and to illustrate the principles developed in Chapters 1 to 7.

Not even her farewell gift of a model medieval castle helps him feel better—though he has to admit it's fascinating. From the working drawbridge and portcullis to the fully-furnished rooms, it's perfect in every detail. It almost seems magical.

"	","From the author of The Long Season—considered by many to be the greatest baseball book of all time—comes another classic sports memoir by legendary pitcher Jim Brosnan, which chronicles how his team, the Cincinnati Reds, went on to win the 1961 National League pennant. With legendary pitcher Jim Brosnan’s first book, The Long Season, he not only entered the canon of great sports literature, but also redefined it when he returned two years later to write Pennant Race—his memoir of his days playing for the Cincinnati Reds and how the team went from not being taken seriously as a pennant contender to having a shot at the 1961 National League pennant. In Pennant Race, Brosnan—with his trademark wise-guy wit and plain-spoken practicality—once again offers a refreshingly candid alternative to hackneyed baseball mythologizing. Day by day, game by game, Brosnan reveals the real lives of professional ballplayers: their exhilaration and frustration, hope and despair, chronic worry over job security, playful camaraderie, world-weary cynicism, and boyish—if cautious—optimism. Although the Reds would ultimately lose the World Series to the Yankees, for Brosnan and his teammates, this was a winning season. Pennant Race vividly captures a remarkable year in the life of a ball club and the golden age of one of Major League Baseball’s most memorable eras. “Brosnan obviously knows his baseball, writes about it wittily, informally and with irony. He is a cynical, tough professional athlete and his book makes wonderful reading.”—New Yorker",['James P.

""I have been wondering about them almost ever since we left Vancouver. They don't seem to speak to a person, and seldom to each other, though somehow they appear to be traveling in company. They act as if they were afraid someone would recognize them. I am sure they aren't bad characters."" Captain Petersen, commander of the steamer ""Corsair,"" which for some days had been plowing its way through the ever-changing northern waters, stroked his grizzled beard reflectively. ""Bad characters, eh?"" he twinkled. ""Well, no, I shouldn't say as they were. They're fair-weather lads. I'll vouch for them if necessary, and I guess I'm about the only person on board that knows who they are."" Tad waited expectantly until the skipper came to the point of the story he was telling. ""They are the Gold Diggers of Taku Pass, lad."" ""The Gold Diggers of Taku Pass?"" repeated Tad Butler. ""I don't think I ever heard that name before. Where is this pass, sir?"" The skipper shook his head. ""No one knows,"" he said. ""That is strange,"" wondered Butler. ""Does no one know where they dig for gold?"" ""No. They don't even know themselves,"" was the puzzling reply. Tad fixed the weather-beaten face of the skipper with a questioning gaze. ""I don't think I understand, sir.

Prominent academics and artists view actor training through a political, cultural or ethical lens, tackling fraught topics about power as it plays out in acting curricula and classrooms.

"The placebo effect is a fascinating but elusive phenomena. Although no standard definition of the placebo effect exists	"The placebo effect is a fascinating but elusive phenomena. Although no standard definition of the placebo effect exists, it is generally understood as consisting of responses of individuals to the psychosocial context of medical treatments or clinical encounters, as distinct from specific physiological effects of medical interventions. The Placebo is the first book to compile a selection of classic and contemporary published articles on the topic. Systematic investigation of the placebo effect emerged in the 1950s in response to the development of randomized controlled clinical trials that used “inert” placebo interventions as a pivotal element of scientific evaluation of novel drugs. In recent years, scientific and scholarly investigation of the placebo effect has increased dramatically, reflecting a growing interest in the connection between mind and body with respect to health, the development of brain imaging techniques, dissatisfaction with the reductionist and technological orientation of biomedicine, and growing attention to the use of complementary and alternative medical treatments. The Placebo is organized into three sections: the nature and significance of the placebo effect, experimental studies of the placebo effect, and ethical issues of placebos in research and in clinical practice. This comprehensive sourcebook will be invaluable to investigators and scholars alike.","['Franklin G. Miller', 'Luana Colloca', 'Ted J.

This book examines the origins of ASEAN's diplomatic and security culture and analyses how over time its key principles have been practised and contested as ASEAN states have responded to regional conflicts as well as challenges posed by the major regional powers, ASEAN's enlargement, and the Asian financial crisis.

Published in the late 1930s by New York Times–bestselling author Gwen Bristow, the Plantation Trilogy is an epic series of novels that bring to life the history of Louisiana—from its settlement in the late eighteenth century to the realities of slavery and poverty to the post–World War I era—via the intertwined lives of the members of three families: the Sheramys, the Larnes, and the Upjohns. Deep Summer is the story of Puritan pioneer Judith Sheramy and adventurer Philip Larne, who marry and strive to build an empire in the Louisiana wilderness during the American Revolution. The Handsome Road tells the story of plantation mistress Ann Sheramy Larne and poor seamstress Corrie May Upjohn, who forge an unlikely bond of friendship as they struggle to survive the cataclysms of the Civil War and Reconstruction. This Side of Glory presents the story of Eleanor Upjohn, a modern young woman in the early twentieth century who marries charming Kester Larne and struggles to save the debt-ridden plantation that her husband’s ancestors founded more than one hundred years ago.",['Gwen Bristow'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hvycBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=hvycBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Handsome+road&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2015-05-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hvycBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],2.0	R

These are the only codes that are recognized by modern biology. In this book, however, Marcello Barbieri explains that there are many more organic codes in nature, and their appearance not only took place throughout the history of life but marked the major steps of that history. A code establishes a correspondence between two independent worlds , and the codemaker is a third party between those worlds . Therefore the cell can be thought of as a trinity of genotype, phenotype and ribotype. The ancestral ribotypes were the agents which gave rise to the first cells. The book goes on to explain how organic codes and organic memories can be used to shed new light on the problems encountered in cell signalling, epigenesis, embryonic development, and the evolution of language.",['Marcello Barbieri'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cvskkoD7rx0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cvskkoD7rx0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Organic+Codes:+An+Introduction+to+Semantic+Biology&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cambridge University Press,2003,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cvskkoD7rx0C&dq=The+Organic+Codes:+An+Introduction+to+Semantic+Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Medical'],	R

 Resilience	 Resilience, And Resistance","There is no other published book in English studying the constitution of the Roman Republic as a whole. Yet the Greek historian Polybius believed that the constitution was a fundamental cause of the exponential growth of Rome's empire. He regarded the Republic as unusual in two respects: first, because it functioned so well despite being a mix of monarchy, oligarchy and democracy; secondly, because the constitution was the product of natural evolution rather than the ideals of a lawgiver.Even if historians now seek more widely for the causes of Rome's rise to power, the importance and influence of her political institutions remains. The reasons for Rome's power are both complex, on account of the mix of elements, and flexible, inasmuch as they were not founded on written statutes but on unwritten traditions reinterpreted by successive generations.

"There is no excuse for not teaching preventive	"There is no excuse for not teaching preventive, healthy coping strategies to prepare kids for their teenage years. -- Ronald R. Brill In his innovative book, Emotional Honesty & Self-Acceptance, Ronald Brill, a former university professor and health educator, argues that youth can learn how to self-manage upsetting and stressful experiences. This work explains the relationship between recognizing and dealing with emotional pain, which is essential to avoid harmful behavior toward ones self and others. Since the book was published in 2000 he continues to research and develop training programs for educators, including advising schools and student services professionals so they can more effectively help students learn and practice brain-based coping skills to reduce thigh risk emotional stress. This book contains guiding principles used in classroom programs he introduced to over 700 4th to 6th grade elementary students from 2002 to 2008. His virtual classroom website, www.copingskills4kids.net, helps schools, parents and counselors guide children in the use of healthy and safe coping skills. The book and website are designed to enable recovery from everyday emotional pain caused by loss, rejection, betrayal and humiliation. He refers to these as universal, core Emotionally Wounding Experiences. Like physical wounds, emotional ones can also be infected if left unattended or ignored. His classroom programs prove that by age of nine, students can learn these lessons to begin preparing for the turbulent teenage years. Violence prevention is an important benefit of developing emotional resilience and self-acceptance. The authors commitment to brain-based coping skills learning is now shared by tens of thousands of individuals and institutions around the world seeking new ways to help youth avoid harming others for the emotionally wounds they may otherwise have not learned to heal. The 300-page book uses analysis of school shooting incidents to advocate new strategies schools and parents can use to boost kids coping confidence needed to more easily get over inevitable emotionally painful and stressful experiences. It is written for mature teenagers and adults. This powerful tool provides evidence to those advocating coping skills education programs at home and school. This approach with todays youth can make them more responsible and self-accepting persons. It also helps them develop new capabilities to deal with the emotional challenges and changes during adolescence. Some Introductory Chapter Titles: What We Dont Know About Hurt Feelings Can Kill Us!

A must-have for Christmas, this edition should be as necessary to your festivities as holly, mistletoe and silver bells.",['Charles Dickens'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aGtSzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=aGtSzQEACAAJ&dq=Christmas+with+Dickens&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage Classic,2020-11-05,http://books.google.nl/books?id=aGtSzQEACAAJ&dq=Christmas+with+Dickens&hl=&source=gbs_api,,	R

"Sent to live in the humidity of rural Florida with his grandparents and his sixteen-year-old Aunt Delia for the summer	"Sent to live in the humidity of rural Florida with his grandparents and his sixteen-year-old Aunt Delia for the summer, twelve-year-old Travis becomes absorbed in the closed ways of small-town life. Captivated by Delia, Travis watches her attempt to find a place for herself in the socially stunted, gossip-driven town. Delia's secrets go beyond what Travis can understand, but he believes that he alone can save her--a belief that not only forces him to grow up fast, but one that builds to a dangerous and disturbing climax. In trying to free Delia from her past, Travis leads her into a shocking present and a most uncertain future. In a work at once honest, chilling and compulsively addictive, author Sterling Watson has created a time and place where rock 'n' roll hums from AM radios, steam rises from a secluded riverbed and violent summer storms threaten the peace of silent nights. Watson's characters are brought vividly to life through Travis's touching, powerful and intensely personal voice. A dark and evocative coming of age tale, Sweet Dream Baby begins steeped in innocence and ends in a dramatically different place. ""I can't remember a book that sneaked up and grabbed me the way Sweet Dream Baby did. It's a real shocker by a very good writer."" --Elmore Leonard ""Sterling Watson's Sweet Dream Baby is one of the finest novels I've read in years, an incandescent blend of gothic noir, Faulknerian dreamscape and bittersweet coming-of-age story.

Customers and suppliers require fully integrated information - throughout the supply chain or value chain. You must integrate your organization so completely that executive decisions are implemented effortlessly. Competitive pressures often cause a reduction in prices, in spite of continually rising costs. A decrease in prices paired with increased costs quickly eliminates any profitability and threatens your company's ability to survive. This book shows you how you can reduce costs through the elimination of waste caused by poor communication and coordination throughout a company as well as between the company, its suppliers, and its customers. The author explains Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) in non-technical terms, describing how an ERP system can fully integrate all functions in your manufacturing organization. He demonstrates the system's capability to increase efficiency and profitability - and to delight the customer - as well as its current deficiencies. In addition to his thorough coverage of ERP, the author introduces Total Enterprise Integration (TEI), the process of integrating all the information required to fully support a manufacturing company. TEI represents a logical extension of complete information integration throughout a manufacturing enterprise and into the supply chain. This new concept shows you how the intelligent use of work flow allows responsibility to go to the most appropriate front-line decision makers while maintaining proper budgetary and operational controls. The power of TEI is in the integration of communication across the entire manufacturing company, and out through the supply chain to customers and suppliers. Enterprise Resource Planning and Beyond: Integrating Your Entire Organization focuses on what a fully integrated system can do for you.

"Food - its cultivation	"Food - its cultivation, preparation and communal consumption - has long been considered a form of cultural heritage. A dynamic, living product, food creates social bonds as it simultaneously marks off and maintains cultural difference. In bringing together anthropologists, historians and other scholars of food and heritage, this volume closely examines the ways in which the cultivation, preparation, and consumption of food is used to create identity claims of 'cultural heritage' on local, regional, national and international scales. Contributors explore a range of themes, including how food is used to mark insiders and outsiders within an ethnic group; how the same food's meanings change within a particular society based on class, gender or taste; and how traditions are 'invented' for the revitalization of a community during periods of cultural pressure. Featuring case studies from Europe, Asia and the Americas, this timely volume also addresses the complex processes of classifying, designating, and valorizing food as 'terroir,' 'slow food,' or as intangible cultural heritage through UNESCO. By effectively analyzing food and foodways through the perspectives of critical heritage studies, this collection productively brings two overlapping but frequently separate theoretical frameworks into conversation.","['Ronda L.

"In this provocative book	"In this provocative book, C.

For centuries the books of the Apocrypha have had a significant influence on Christian art, literature, and theology.",['Hendrickson Publishers'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EvniktHFaesC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=EvniktHFaesC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+New+Revised+Standard+Version+Bible+with+Apocrypha&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Hendrickson Publishers,2005-08,http://books.google.nl/books?id=EvniktHFaesC&dq=The+New+Revised+Standard+Version+Bible+with+Apocrypha&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Bibles'],1.0	R

"The privilege is given to me	"The privilege is given to me, as an elder, to pen a word of introduction to this little book, the first written by a younger Brother, young in body verily, but not in Soul. The teachings contained in it were given to him by his Master in preparing him for Initiation, and were written down by him from memory - slowly and laboriously, for his English last year was far less fluent than it is now. The greater part is a reproduction of the Master's own words; that which is not such a verbal reproduction is the Master's thought clothed in His pupil's words. Two omitted sentences were supplied by the Master. In two other cases an omitted word has been added. Beyond this, it is entirely Alcyone's own, his first gift to the world. May it help others as the spoken teachings helped him - such is the hope with which he gives it. But the teaching can only be fruitful if it is lived, as he has lived it, since it fell from the Master's lips. If the example be followed as well as the precept, then for the reader, as for the writer, shall the great Portal swing open, and his feet be set on the Path.

"Enjoy free will	"Enjoy free will, but prepare for destiny. Welcome to Book 2 of Rae Crossmon's White Rock Series. Familiar faces. New players. Ancient conflicts. Fresh battles. One overriding sentiment: Free will is a terrible thing. But it’s better than the alternative. Jessica McConsas is in love with three men. Perhaps one is evil. Perhaps one is good. Perhaps one is just a catalyst. But it's never that easy when it comes to White Rock. While campaigning for her father, Jessica becomes involved with Piers, a reclusive and mysterious young man. She also finds an unlikely ally in an old friend, Vance Munroe Easton, who helps her discover the truth behind a dark family mystery. Last but not least, Jess struggles to forget Evan Helmsley and their night in the snowstorm, something much easier said than done. On the other side of the country, Evan learns how to be a friend, with the help of an extraordinary woman. Sondra has her own secrets, but she doesn't share them until it's too late. Her decisions offer Evan a chance to redeem himself by taking responsibility for another child—maybe doing it right this time. Evan’s sister Henri has to decide how much she believes in old legends, while her lover Byrne finds he is still capable of being surprised. When Henri finally meets the daughter she gave away, an old dream collides harshly with reality. A new family joins the fray. When Anderson Annolla conceives a young child from a vacation tryst, she becomes caught in an old war between Jackson, the father of her son, and Jarenth, his half-brother. Andy must ally with Jarenth to save Heath, while protecting a dark secret from her own past. Jack’s resentment and jealousy fuel a decision to hurt Andy with an action that has tragic consequences for all involved.

"The third novel in the Earth's Children series	"The third novel in the Earth's Children series, Jean M. Auel's internationally bestselling epic of life 25,000 years ago when two kinds of human beings, Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon, shared the earth. Leaving the valley of horses with Jondalar, the handsome man she has nursed back to health and come to love, Ayla embarks on a journey that will lead her to the Mamutoi, the Mammoth Hunters, who are Others like her. As she settles into this new life among a people at first strange and disturbingly different, soon Ayla begins to feel at home, finally leaving her painful memories of the Clan behind and finding female friends. Yet Ayla is also drawn to Ranec, the dark-skinned, magnetic master-carver of ivory. Ayla must choose: remain with Ranec and the Mamutoi, or follow Jondalar into the unknown . . . Set 25,000 years in the past, yet utterly relatable today, The Mammoth Hunters is an epic tale of love, identity and the struggle to survive, rich in detail of language, culture, myth and ritual.

"‘Levi is een humanist	"‘Levi is een humanist, die in staat was gebleken onder de allerergste omstandigheden zijn waardigheid te behouden.’ NRC Handelsblad De Joods-Italiaanse verzetsstrijder Primo Levi trok in 1943 de bergen in, maar hij werd al na enkele maanden gepakt en naar Auschwitz gedeporteerd. Als een van de weinigen overleefde hij die hel en keerde hij terug en schreef, aanvankelijk uit een chaotische, blinde drang, Is dit een mens. In dit boek beschrijft hij in heldere taal en nuchter het leven in het kamp, de angst, de honger, de pijn, de ontberingen, de verschrikkingen. Het wordt terecht als een van de klassieke getuigenissen over de Jodenvervolging beschouwd. In de pers ‘Wat Primo Levi kon, was de afgrijselijkste en grootste misdaad in de moderne geschiedenis, de Holocaust, van binnenuit zo beschrijven, dat hij recht doet aan de complexiteit ervan.

"'a brilliant history' The Sunday Times 'makes for riveting reading' The Independent Modern pagan witchcraft is arguably the only fully-formed religion England has given the world	"'a brilliant history' The Sunday Times 'makes for riveting reading' The Independent Modern pagan witchcraft is arguably the only fully-formed religion England has given the world, and has now spread across four continents. This second edition of The Triumph of the Moon extensively revises the first full-scale scholarly study of modern pagan witchcraft. Ronald Hutton examines the nature and development of this religion, and offers a history of attitudes to witchcraft, paganism and magic in British society since 1800. Its pages reveal village cunning folk, Victorian ritual magicians, classicists and archaeologists, leaders of woodcraft and scouting movements, Freemasons, and members of rural secret societies. We also find some of the leading figures of English literature, from the Romantic poets to W. B. Yeats, D. H. Lawrence and Robert Graves, as well as the main personalities who have represented pagan witchcraft to the public world since 1950. Thriller writers like Dennis Wheatley, and films and television programmes, get similar coverage, as does tabloid journalism. The material is by its nature often sensational, and care is taken throughout to distinguish fact from fantasy, in a manner not previously applied to most of the stories involved. Meticulously researched, The Triumph of the Moon presents an authoritative insight into an aspect of modern cultural history which has attracted sensational publicity but has hitherto been little understood. This edition incorporates new research carried out by the author as well as research by others who have been inspired by this book over the twenty years since its first publication.",['Ronald Hutton'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=25OzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=25OzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Triumph+of+the+Moon:+A+History+of+Modern+Pagan+Witchcraft&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Oxford University Press,2019-10-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=25OzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",6.0	R

"In 1807	"In 1807, Robert Fulton, using an English mail-order steam engine, chugged four miles an hour up the Hudson River, passing into popular folklore as the inventor of the steamboat. However, the true first passenger steamboat in America, and the world, was built from scratch, and plied the Delaware River in 1790, almost two decades earlier. Its inventor, John Fitch, never attained Fulton's riches, and was rewarded with ridicule and poverty. Considering there was not a single working steam engine in America in the early 1780s, Fitch's steamboat's development was nothing short of remarkable. But he faced competition from the start, and he and several other inventors fought a string of bitter battles, legal and otherwise. Steam tells the dramatic story of Fitch and his adversaries, weaving their lives into a fascinating tale including the likes of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin. It is the story behind America's first important venture in technology, the persevering and colorful men that made it happen, and the great invention that moved a new nation westward.",['Andrea Sutcliffe'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0hJ4BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0hJ4BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Steam:+The+Untold+Story+Of+America%27s+First+Great+Invention&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,St. Martin's Press,2015-03-24,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0hJ4BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],	R

"	","""Fundamentally, labor's story is the story of the American people. To view it narrowly, to concentrate on the history of specific trade unions or on the careers of individuals and their rivalries, would be to miss the point that the great forces which have swept the American people into action have been the very forces that have also molded labor. Trade unionism was born as an effective national movement amid the great convulsion of the Civil War and the fight for black freedom... Labor suffered under depressions which spurred the whole American people into movement in the seventies, in the eighties, and in the nineties. It reached its greatest heights when it joined hands with farmers, small businessmen, and the black people in the epic Populist revolts of the 1890's and later in the triumph that was the New Deal. For labor has never lived in isolation or progressed without allies. Always it has been in the main stream of American life,... Labor's story, by its very nature, is synchronized at every turn with the growth and development of American monopoly. Its great leap forward into industrial unionism was an answering action to the development of trusts and great industrial empires. Labor's grievances, in fact the very conditions of its life, have been imposed by its great antagonist, that combination of industrial and financial power often known as Wall Street. The mind and actions of William H. Sylvis, the iron molder who founded the first effective national labor organization, can scarcely be understood without also an understanding of the genius and cunning of his contemporary, John D. Rockefeller, father of the modern trust. In the long view of history the machinations of J. P. Morgan, merging banking and industrial capital as he threw together ever larger combinations of corporate power controlled by fewer and fewer men, may have governed the course of American labor more than the plans of Samuel Gompers."" -- Amazon.com viewed January 11, 2021.","['Richard Boyer', 'Richard Owen Boyer', 'Herbert Montfort Morais']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UV7tAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UV7tAAAAMAAJ&q=Labor%27s+untold+story,&dq=Labor%27s+untold+story,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",United Electrical Radio &,1975,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UV7tAAAAMAAJ&dq=Labor%27s+untold+story,&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Business & Economics'],2.0	R

She pays tribute to the extraordinary personal mentors who helped light her way: Martin Luther King, Jr., Robert F. Kennedy, Fannie Lou Hamer, William Sloane Coffin, Ella Baker, Mae Bertha Carter, and many others. She celebrates the lives of the great Black women of Bennettsville, South Carolina-Miz Tee, Miz Lucy, Miz Kate-who along with her parents formed a formidable and loving network of community support for the young Marian Wright as a Black girl growing up in the segregated South. We follow the author to Spelman College in the late 1950s, when the school was a hotbed of civil rights activism, and where, through excerpts from her honest and passionate college journal, we witness a national leader in the making and meet the people who inspired and empowered her, including Dr. Benjamin E. Mays, Howard Zinn, and Charles E. Merrill, Jr. Lanterns takes us to Mississippi in the 1960s, where Edelman was the first and only Black woman lawyer. Her account of those years is a riveting first-hand addition to the literature of civil rights: ""The only person I recognized in the menacing crowd as I walked towards the front courthouse steps was [a] veteran New York Times reporter. He neither acknowledged me nor met my eyes. I knew then what it was like to be a poor Black person in Mississippi: alone."" And we follow Edelman as she leads Bobby Kennedy on his fateful trip to see Mississippi poverty and hunger for himself, a powerful personal experience for the young RFK that helped awaken a nation's conscience to child hunger and poverty. Lanterns is illustrated with thirty of the author's personal photographs and includes ""A Parent's Pledge"" and ""Twenty-five More Lessons for Life,"" an inspiration to all of us-parents, grandparents, teachers, religious and civic leaders-to guide, protect, and love our children every day so that they will become, in Marian Wright Edelman's moving vision, the healing agents for national transformation.",['Marian Wright Edelman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GBbCGs_eE_IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=GBbCGs_eE_IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Lanterns:+A+Memoir+of+Mentors&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Beacon Press,2013-05-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GBbCGs_eE_IC&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],	R

 Race	 Race, and Mexican Americans","This sweeping history explores the growing Latino presence in the United States over the past two hundred years. It also debunks common myths about Silicon Valley, one of the world's most influential but least-understood places. Far more than any label of the moment, the devil of racism has long been Silicon Valley's defining force, and Stephen Pitti argues that ethnic Mexicans--rather than computer programmers--should take center stage in any contemporary discussion of the ""new West."" Pitti weaves together the experiences of disparate residents--early Spanish-Mexican settlers, Gold Rush miners, farmworkers transplanted from Texas, Chicano movement activists, and late-twentieth-century musicians--to offer a broad reevaluation of the American West. Based on dozens of oral histories as well as unprecedented archival research, The Devil in Silicon Valley shows how San José, Santa Clara, and other northern California locales played a critical role in the ongoing development of Latino politics. This is a transnational history. In addition to considering the past efforts of immigrant and U.S.-born miners, fruit cannery workers, and janitors at high-tech firms--many of whom retained strong ties to Mexico--Pitti describes the work of such well-known Valley residents as César Chavez. He also chronicles the violent opposition ethnic Mexicans have faced in Santa Clara Valley. In the process, he reinterprets not only California history but the Latino political tradition and the story of American labor. This book follows California race relations from the Franciscan missions to the Gold Rush, from the New Almaden mine standoff to the Apple janitorial strike. As the first sustained account of Northern California's Mexican American history, it challenges conventional thinking and tells a fascinating story. Bringing the past to bear on the present, The Devil in Silicon Valley is counter-history at its best.",['Stephen J.

When Civil War veteran John Carter was mysteriously transported to Mars—known by its inhabitants as Barsoom—he found love with Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, and a home closer to his heart than any he knew on Earth. After being sent unwillingly back to his native planet, Carter is finally making his return to Barsoom. But instead of arriving at the land of Helium, he finds himself a world away from his Martian love—in the Valley of Dor.

 Design and Operation"	 Design and Operation","This book presents the ideas and industrial concepts in compact heat exchanger technology that have been developed in the last 10 years or so. Historically, the development and application of compact heat exchangers and their surfaces has taken place in a piecemeal fashion in a number of rather unrelated areas, principally those of the automotive and prime mover, aerospace, cryogenic and refrigeration sectors. Much detailed technology, familiar in one sector, progressed only slowly over the boundary into another sector. This compartmentalisation was a feature both of the user industries themselves, and also of the supplier, or manufacturing industries. These barriers are now breaking down, with valuable cross-fertilisation taking place. One of the industrial sectors that is waking up to the challenges of compact heat exchangers is that broadly defined as the process sector. If there is a bias in the book, it is towards this sector. Here, in many cases, the technical challenges are severe, since high pressures and temperatures are often involved, and working fluids can be corrosive, reactive or toxic. The opportunities, however, are correspondingly high, since compacts can offer a combination of lower capital or installed cost, lower temperature differences (and hence running costs), and lower inventory. In some cases they give the opportunity for a radical re-think of the process design, by the introduction of process intensification (PI) concepts such as combining process elements in one unit. An example of this is reaction and heat exchange, which offers, among other advantages, significantly lower by-product production. To stimulate future research, the author includes coverage of hitherto neglected approaches, such as that of the Second Law (of Thermodynamics), pioneered by Bejan and co- workers. The justification for this is that there is increasing interest in life-cycle and sustainable approaches to industrial activity as a whole, often involving exergy (Second Law) analysis. Heat exchangers, being fundamental components of energy and process systems, are both savers and spenders of exergy, according to interpretation.",['John E.

"""This book is as seductive as the phenomenon that it explores. With courage	"""This book is as seductive as the phenomenon that it explores. With courage, love, and joy, Frueh crosses into unexplored terrains of beauty and pleasure, where she finds a grotesquely captivating creature: Monster/Beauty. By illuminating her journey with thoughtful insight and engaging prose, she encourages readers to join her in her quest to articulate fresh ways of thinking about the aesthetic and the erotic and of theorizing the flux of lived experience."" —John Alan Farmer, senior editor of Art Journal ""Monster/Beauty is a daringly provocative experiment in personal and erotic writing and an important book for anyone interested in breaking normative codes of beauty, pedagogy, and authorial methodology. In a richly self-revealing text, Frueh proposes nothing less than a Rabellaisian re-ordering of aesthetic embodiments within social relations."" —Mira Schor, author of Wet: On Painting, Feminism, and Art Culture ""Giving new meaning to ""embodied writing,"" this book goes farther than any other toward getting the body into the text. Joanna Frueh is a performance artist first-she is also an art historian, a singer, a poet, a bodybuilder, a professor, an academic celebrity of modest fame, but her performances collapse these distinctions. Frueh's intensely personal, intensely physical prose brings an aura of presence to the book that rivals the effect she achieves on stage."" —Robyn Warhol, co-editor of Feminisms ""This book is monstrous--full of gorgeous hypermuscular women, step-mothers, and vampires; full of ravishing muscular sex, classroom erotics, splendid aging. It is a performance in which Frueh explores and celebrates her body, its powers and beauties, and those of her friends and lovers."" —Alphonso Lingis, author of Excesses, Abuses, and Dangerous Emotions ""A welcome voice in contemporary feminist theory, Frueh's Monster/Beauty reminds us of the pleasures of thinking, teaching and creating in wholly embodied, sensual and passionate acts. Frueh poetically enacts the self as an aesthetic/erotic project, affirming the many different and beautiful selves we can become.

Ten years later, after surviving the First World War, he visits the shepherd again and sees the young forest he has created spreading slowly over the valley.

These readings appeared first in magazines and newspapers including the Progressive and the Boston Globe, as well as in Zinn's books, Failure to Quit, Vietnam: The Logic of Withdrawal, The Politics of History, and Declarations of Independence.

In his essay, ""Just and Unjust War,"" Zinn challenges us to fight for justice ""with struggle, but without war.""

Hong Kong is truly a society in transition, a society whose time is running short and which therefore cannot afford to wait long before it has to make decisive choices, choices also in ethics. The time factor which is so infamous in various ethical dilemmas applies here to the society as a whole; it may also account for some of its not just morally significant shortcomings. II. Ethics in a Cross-cultural Perspective The authors of this volume are scholars and researchers based in Hong 3 Kong who have been living and working in the territory for many years. They are not only representative of the increased research interest in ethical issues across the academic spectrum of Hong Kong universities, but also of the inter disciplinary approach which has become the hallmark of work in applied eth ics.

"Interlacing humor into his ongoing narrative	"Interlacing humor into his ongoing narrative, Robert Allen Rutland provides in The Democrats a readable, balanced account of how the Democratic party was founded, evolved, nearly died, and came back in the twentieth century, flourishing as a political melting pot despite numerous setbacks. This updated version of Rutland's much-heralded The Democrats: From Jefferson to Carter provides new insight into the long hiatus in the Democrats' presence in the White House between Carter and Clinton. In additon to analyzing Carter's successes and failures as president, Rutland also examines the forces that went into the Democratic defeats and Republican victories in 1980, 1984, and 1988, concluding with the election of another Jeffersonian Democrat, William Jefferson Clinton. The book ends with an examination of the dramatic results of the 1994 congressional elections that began to alert President Clinton to the challenge he would face in winning reelection in 1996.",['Robert Rutland'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nQ1rAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=nQ1rAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Democrats:+From+Jefferson+to+Clinton&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Missouri Press,1995-10-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=nQ1rAwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Democrats:+From+Jefferson+to+Clinton&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],	R

The world does not seem made for me' Giacomo Leopardi, considered the greatest Italian poet since Dante, was one of the most radical thinkers of the nineteenth century. He also regarded himself one of the most miserable and unfortunate people to have lived. Born to strict parents in a provincial town in 1798, he had a lonely childhood, and he spent his time largely in his father's library. He suffered from a debilitating illness, and his short life was full of pain. But this pain and misery gave rise to some of the most intense and brilliant poems ever written in the Italian language. In this poetic biography, Iris Origo, author of the bestselling War in Val d'Orcia traces the short and lonely life of this conflicted poet. Written with generosity and understanding, A Study in Solitude is a sharp, moving portrait of a frail and frustrated genius. Iris Origo (1902-1988) was a British-born biographer and writer. She lived in Italy and devoted much of her life to the improvement of the Tuscan estate at La Foce, which she purchased with her husband in the 1920s. During WWII, she sheltered refugee children and assisted many escaped Allied prisoners of war and partisans in defiance of Italy's fascist regime and Nazi occupation forces.

The word Saga might be objected to on the ground that it connotes the heroic and that there is little heroism in these pages. But it is used with a suitable irony; and, after all, this long tale, though it may deal with folk in frock coats, furbelows, and a gilt-edged period, is not devoid of the essential heat of conflict. Discounting for the gigantic stature and blood-thirstiness of old days, as they have come down to us in fairy-tale and legend, the folk of the old Sagas were Forsytes, assuredly, in their possessive instincts, and as little proof against the inroads of beauty and passion as Swithin, Soames, or even Young Jolyon. And if heroic figures, in days that never were, seem to startle out from their surroundings in fashion unbecoming to a Forsyte of the Victorian era, we may be sure that tribal instinct was even then the prime force, and that family and the sense of home and property counted as they do to this day, for all the recent efforts to talk them out.",['John Galsworthy'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ChUxEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ChUxEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Forsythe+Saga&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,FilRougeViceversa,2021-08-27,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ChUxEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],20.0	R

"The information revolution--which is as much an organizational as a technological revolution--is transforming the nature of conflict across the spectrum: from open warfare	"The information revolution--which is as much an organizational as a technological revolution--is transforming the nature of conflict across the spectrum: from open warfare, to terrorism, crime, and even radical social activism. The era of massed field armies is passing, because the new information and communications systems are increasing the lethality of quite small units that can call in deadly, precise missile fire almost anywhere, anytime. In social conflicts, the Internet and other media are greatly empowering individuals and small groups to influence the behavior of states. Whether in military or social conflicts, all protagonists will soon be developing new doctrines, strategies, and tactics for swarming their opponents--with weapons or words, as circumstances require. Preparing for conflict in such a world will require shifting to new forms of organization, particularly the versatile, hardy, all-channel network. This shift will prove difficult for states and professional militaries that remain bastions of hierarchy, bound to resist institutional redesign. They will make the shift as they realize that information and knowledge are becoming the key elements of power. This implies, among other things, that Mars, the old brute-force god of war, must give way to Athena, the well-armed goddess of wisdom. Accepting Athena as the patroness of this information age represents a first step not only for preparing for future conflicts, but also for preventing them.","['John Arquilla', 'David Ronfeldt']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qJGawYmm6b4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=qJGawYmm6b4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=In+Athena%27s+Camp:+Preparing+for+Conflict+in+the+Information+Age&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Rand Corporation,1997-10-07,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qJGawYmm6b4C&source=gbs_api,['Computers'],1.0	R
"No state in the entire Nation is richer in Indian names	"No state in the entire Nation is richer in Indian names, or in fact, in Indian history than Pennsylvania. These Indian names of Pennsylvania are full of music, but, of far greater importance, they are full of history. A History of the Indian Villages and Place Names in Pennsylvania, which was first published in 1928, is the only major book of the 20th century that traces Pennsylvania’s Indian place and names for their correct form, origin and history. Its pages are filled with the most incredible collection of information ever assembled on the Indian villages of Pennsylvania and their Indian place names and is an Indian history scholar’s delight. In preparing his book, Dr. Donehoo researched every available source of printed material about Indian place names in Pennsylvania. He also walked nearly every Indian trail, from the Delaware to the Ohio, using early trader’s journals and maps as his guide, to seek out the places the Indians lived. Each Indian name comes complete with historical notes by the author. The book includes a list of all the sources used to authenticate each Indian place name. An excellent bibliography follows at the conclusion of the work along with appendixes listing: the Indian villages of New York destroyed by General Sullivan’s army in 1779, prehistoric works in Pennsylvania by county, and an alphabetical listing of all Indian named places in each county.",['George P.

So far as possible, without giving aid to the enemy, it is the complete story of the Commandos since the very beginning of their activities, commencing with the experimental attacks on Norwegian islands, and proceeding with more ambitious attempts on the Continent. In quick succession follow highly dramatic accounts of the assault on southern Italy, the evacuation of Crete, the defeat of the French in Syria, the daring penetration of the enemy’s line in Libya—culminating in the suspenseful stalking of Rommel’s headquarters—the assault on St. Nazaire, the capture of Madagascar, the Dieppe raid, the invasion of North Africa. The book is utterly without heroics, and yet is all heroism. The reader marvels at the terrible efficiency, the terrible simplicity, the terrible courage and the awesome nonchalance of the British Royal Navy and Army and R.A.F. men who participate in these raids.

It's the worst possible time for Detective Kerri Devlin to be involved in an all-consuming double-homicide case. She's locked in a bitter struggle with her ex-husband and teenage daughter, and her reckless new partner is anything but trustworthy. Still, she has a job to do: there's a killer at large, and a pregnant woman has gone missing. Once Devlin and her partner get to work, they quickly unearth secrets involving Birmingham's most esteemed citizens. Each new layer of the investigation brings Devlin closer to the killer and the missing woman, who starts looking more like a suspect than a victim. But just as answers come into view, the case twists, expands, and slithers into Devlin's personal life. There's a much more sinister game at work, one she doesn't even know she's playing--and she must unravel the truth once and for all to stop the killer before she loses everything.",['Debra Webb'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0rqVygEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0rqVygEACAAJ&dq=Trust+No+One&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Thomas & Mercer,2020-08,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0rqVygEACAAJ&dq=Trust+No+One&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1.0	R

Mayes is vooral bekend van haar idyllische boeken over het Toscaanse leven, zoals ‘Een huis in Toscane’ en ‘Bella Toscane’. In haar meeslepende debuutroman krijgt archeoloog Ginger Mason een telefoontje dat haar leven voorgoed verandert. Het lichaam van haar overleden moeder is om mysterieuze redenen opgegraven. Halsoverkop vertrekt ze naar haar geboorteplaatsje Swan, waar ze samen met haar broer de ware oorzaak van haar moeders dood probeert te achterhalen. Welke verborgen familiegeheimen komen nog meer aan het licht? De Amerikaanse Frances Mayes (1940) schrijft romans, gedichten en geprezen memoires over haar leven in Italië. Haar bekendste werk is ‘Een huis in Toscane’, waarin ze haar ontmoeting met de Italiaanse cultuur, de culinaire hoogstandjes en het betoverende landschap beschrijft. Het stond maar liefst twee jaar lang op de New York Times-bestsellerlijst en werd verfilmd met als titel ‘Under the Tuscan sun’, met Diane Lane in de hoofdrol. Andere bekende werken van Mayes zijn de memoires ‘Bella Toscane’, ‘Elke dag in Toscane’ en de roman ‘Het geheim van Swan’. Met haar schrijftalent en passie voor reizen en koken waant de lezer zich ogenblikkelijk in het idyllische Italië.

"Rowdy	"Rowdy, ecstatic, and sometimes stern, these teaching stories and fables reveal new and very human properties in Rumi's vision. Included here are the notorious “Latin parts” that Reynold Nicholson felt were too unseemly to appear in English in his 1920s translation. For Rumi, anything that human beings do—however compulsive—affords a glimpse into the inner life. Here are more than 40 fables or teaching stories that deal with love, laughter, death, betrayal, and the soul. The stories are exuberant, earthy, and bursting with vitality—much like a painting by Hieronymus Bosch or Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. The characters are guilty, lecherous, tricky, ribald, and finally possessors of opened souls. Barks writes: ""These teaching stories are a kind of scrimshaw—intricately carved, busy figures, confused and threatening, and weirdly funny. This is an entertaining collection from one of the greatest spiritual poets of all time, rendered by his most popular translator. “The minute I heard my first love story, I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was.

"The violent imagination begins in experiences of violation against the self and grows through the stories	"The violent imagination begins in experiences of violation against the self and grows through the stories, myths, folktales and anecdotes of everyday life. Originally published in 1986, John Schostak discusses the educational, social and moral implications of the violent imagination in connection with theories of violence, childrearing practices, and schooling as a childrearing institution. He also looks at the relation between sexism, racism, drugs and the emergence of a vandalised sense of self. The book explores the complex ways in which images of violence pervade society, inform action and provide interpretations of events. Schools, the author argues, contribute towards the development of a violent imagination which guides judgements and actions. The child's images and experiences of violation may involve physical assault or psychological forms of assault. Some of these experiences of violation and violence are considered normal, even moral ('spare the rod and spoil the child'); others are considered abnormal, criminal, pathological - although the abstract logical form of each may be equivalent. Nevertheless, all such images contribute towards the development of a sense of violation, and children are schooled to accept normal forms and reject abnormal forms.","['John F Schostak', 'Taylor & Francis Group']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gA5ZzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gA5ZzgEACAAJ&dq=Schooling+As+Violence&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2021-09,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gA5ZzgEACAAJ&dq=Schooling+As+Violence&hl=&source=gbs_api,,	R

"One beautiful September day	"One beautiful September day, three sixty-six-year-old men convene on Martha's Vineyard, friends ever since meeting in college in the 1960s. They couldn't have been more different then, or even today - Lincoln's a commercial real estate broker, Teddy a tiny-press publisher and Mickey an ageing musician. But each man holds his own secrets, in addition to the monumental mystery that none of them has ever stopped puzzling over since 1971: the disappearance of their friend Jacy. Now, decades later, the distant past interrupts the present as the truth about what happened to Jacy finally emerges, forcing the men to reconsider everything they thought they knew about each other. Shot through with Russo's trademark comedy and humanity, Chances Are also introduces a new level of suspense and menace that will quicken the reader's heartbeat throughout this absorbing saga of how friendship's bonds are every bit as constricting and rewarding as those of family. For both longtime fans and lucky newcomers, Chances Are is a stunning demonstration of a highly-acclaimed author deepening and expanding his remarkable body of work.",['Richard Russo'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yceXDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=yceXDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Chances+Are&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Atlantic Books,2019-11-07,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yceXDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],36.0	R

"Who was it who asked	"Who was it who asked, ""Why does the devil have all the good tunes?""The seven ""deadly sins"" are not to be found in scripture as such, but they have been a staple of Christian preaching since the early church. Ken BazynÆs The Seven Perennial Sins and Their Offspring is more indebted to literature than to personal experience, ethics, or the contemporary obsession with psychology. Drawing upon a vast storehouse of reading from a wide variety of disciplines, Bazyn offers a ""thick description"" of each of these ""root"" sins, setting them in a broad temporal, cultural, and human context. The range of reference is enormous. We are as likely to encounter Madame Bovary as Evagrius Ponticus, Jay Gatsby as Blaise Pascal, Francois Truffaut as Francis of Assisi, testifying to the perennial nature of the temptation to pride or anger, gluttony or sloth. We succumb to them over and over partly, says the author quoting Jorge Luis Borges, because ""our minds are porous with forgetfulness."" With the widespread adoption of the Revised Common Lectionary, topical preaching--on the creed, the ten commandments, the beatitudes--has fallen out of use. Thus the even greater need for a book like The Seven Perennial Sins. Without ever moralizing, by means of anecdote and story, the book provides a serious, but often amusing, account of the dark side of the human comedy.",['Ken Bazyn'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JXUtPQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=JXUtPQAACAAJ&dq=Seven+Perennial+Sins+and+Their+Offspring&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bloomsbury Academic,2002-10-23,http://books.google.nl/books?id=JXUtPQAACAAJ&dq=Seven+Perennial+Sins+and+Their+Offspring&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],	R

"The author of this book	"The author of this book, Dennis William Hauck, is a Hermetic scholar versed in both Eastern and Western techniques of alchemy and widely recognized as one of the world's leading experts on the subject. Now, in this book, he makes alchemy's secrets and powers accessible to everyone with the desire to experience physical, mental, and spiritual transformation. By providing clear explanations, moving meditations, and hands-on experiments making tinctures and elixirs, this beautifully illustrated guide passes on the knowledge and creative energy of alchemy's magnificent discipline—sending a golden arc of learning from thousands of years in the past into your life today. Hauck presents a fascinating history of alchemy—from the ancient Emerald Tablet to modern quantum chemistry – and elaborates on its arcane principles in an intimate, conversational way that anyone can understand. His portrayals of individual alchemists bring them alive and show how they built on each other's work through an “Underground River” of secret knowledge passed down through the ages.",['Dennis William Hauck'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jFySlAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=jFySlAEACAAJ&dq=Sorcerer%27s+Stone:+A+Beginner%27s+Guide+to+Alchemy&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Createspace Independent Pub,2013-01-10,http://books.google.nl/books?id=jFySlAEACAAJ&dq=Sorcerer%27s+Stone:+A+Beginner%27s+Guide+to+Alchemy&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Self-Help'],	R

It addresses numerous social issues and how they are presented to the viewer by means of style, rhetoric, and narrative technique. The volume poses questions about the relationship of the documentary tradition to power, the body, authority, knowledge, and our experience of history. This study advances the pioneering work of Nichols's earlier book, Ideology and the Image. The rigorous discussion of modes of documentary representation, the relationship between narrative and nonfiction, and the representation of the body (including a chapter on pornography, ethnography, and power), give this book enormous value for the study of visual anthropology and ethnographic film. The often neglected relationship between signifier and referent is the special focus of this intensive study of documentary film. The concluding discussion of the representation of the body will also be of special interest to semioticians.",['Bill Nichols'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jq2cS7qARd8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Jq2cS7qARd8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Representing+Reality:+Issues+and+Concepts+in+Documentary&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Indiana University Press,1991,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Jq2cS7qARd8C&dq=Representing+Reality:+Issues+and+Concepts+in+Documentary&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Performing Arts'],3.0	R
"Morocco is an exhilarating combination of vivid sensuality and intense spirituality	"Morocco is an exhilarating combination of vivid sensuality and intense spirituality, an intoxicating blend of cultures. Berber, Arab, French, English, and Spanish: the country's rich mixture of heritages is matched by its geography, which ranges from coast to mountain to desert. This revised edition of Living in Morocco celebrates the indigenous arts of a country at the height of a cultural renaissance. Morocco is known for fine leather and for pottery that dates back a thousand years. Berber rugs are justly famous, and there is a thriving tradition of woodworking, especially in the native thuya wood. Most extraordinary, though, is Morocco's decorative painting and tilework, where, forbidden by religion to depict human figures, craftsmen have developed a vocabulary of pattern and ornament. The book is filled with brightly colored ceilings, decorated courtyards and walls, plaster of Paris carved and painted in intricate geometrics, tiles so small that 150 could fit in a matchbox. Lavishly illustrated chapters on decorative and folk arts alternate with chapters on Moroccan life today. We visit Chaouen in the Rif Mountains (a city only recently open to Westerners), where the town's undulating surfaces are painted a bone-chilling blue-tinted white. We peer into an abandoned kasbah in the Sahara, and absorb the sights, sounds, and smells of the frenzied souk. We take time out in the shady blue-and-pink environs of the Majorelle Gardens, laid out by French painter Jacques Majorelle, and explore the story behind La Mamounia, the famous hotel that has welcomed such guests as Winston Churchill. Most important, we see Morocco's arts brought to life in its homesfrom former harems to traditional Hispano-Moorish houses. Glorious photographs make this a treasure for the armchair traveler, while the documentation of Morocco's houses, arts, and crafts make it an invaluable resource for decorators and designers. Published in hardcover under the title Morocco: Designs from Casablanca to Marrakesh. 346 color photographs.",,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tX1d9Q190d8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=tX1d9Q190d8C&dq=Living+in+Morocco:+Design+from+Casablanca+to+Marrakesh&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2001,http://books.google.nl/books?id=tX1d9Q190d8C&dq=Living+in+Morocco:+Design+from+Casablanca+to+Marrakesh&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Architecture'],1.0	R

 The"	 The","The story of the woman taken in adultery features a dramatic confrontation between Jesus and the Pharisees over whether the adulteress should be stoned as the law commands. In response, Jesus famously states, “Let him who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” To Cast the First Stone traces the history of this provocative story from its first appearance to its enduring presence today. Likely added to the Gospel of John in the third century, the passage is often held up by modern critics as an example of textual corruption by early Christian scribes and editors, yet a judgment of corruption obscures the warm embrace the story actually received. Jennifer Knust and Tommy Wasserman trace the story’s incorporation into Gospel books, liturgical practices, storytelling, and art, overturning the mistaken perception that it was either peripheral or suppressed, even in the Greek East. The authors also explore the story’s many different meanings. Taken as an illustration of the expansiveness of Christ’s mercy, the purported superiority of Christians over Jews, the necessity of penance, and more, this vivid episode has invited any number of creative receptions. This history reveals as much about the changing priorities of audiences, scribes, editors, and scholars as it does about an “original” text of John. To Cast the First Stone calls attention to significant shifts in Christian book cultures and the enduring impact of oral tradition on the preservation—and destabilization—of scripture.","['Jennifer Knust', 'Tommy Wasserman']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q5mzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q5mzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR1&dq=Cast,+The&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Princeton University Press,2020-01-14,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q5mzDwAAQBAJ&dq=Cast,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Bibles'],	R

 1880-1920)"	 1880-1920)","Publication of Ian Fletcher's The Poems of John Gray (1988) was welcomed by reviewers in the U.S. and England. Now ELT Press offers a companion volume, The Selected Prose of John Gray. It complements the poetry by printing essays and short stories chosen from different periods of Gray's life--some selections previously unpublished, others having appeared only in limited periodical circulation. This new book adds to our understanding of Gray and topics relevant to the era. Professor McCormack explains the importance of the prose in her introduction: Gray has a significance for his time as a writer who has made the transition from the mannered decadence of ""The Modern Actor"" to the cryptic pre-modernist narrative of Park. As such, his work helps us reconstruct our own past: in particular, it requires us to acknowledge that abyss which lies between the late Victorian and the years after the Great War. As one who survived, not only personally but as a writer, Gray allows us to speculate on the strategies by which he sought to bridge that chasm. And in so doing, John Gray's work may provide an example of how on the edge of greater chasms, we may still presume to tell stories and to feel, in telling them, that they are permitted to tell us something about our experience--and ourselves. Professor McCormack traces the development of Gray's life and writings in her introductory essay. She prefaces each selection with a useful headnote. Her extensive notes to the prose clarify topical allusions and make Gray's work accessible to a wide audience.","['John Gray', 'Jerusha Hull McCormack']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eqNaAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eqNaAAAAMAAJ&q=The+Selected+Prose+of+John+Gray+(British+Authors+Ser,+1880-1920)&dq=The+Selected+Prose+of+John+Gray+(British+Authors+Ser,+1880-1920)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Elt Press,1992,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eqNaAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Selected+Prose+of+John+Gray+(British+Authors+Ser,+1880-1920)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Literary Criticism'],	R

"The story of Free Frank is not only a testament to human courage and resourcefulness but affords new insight into the American frontier. Born a slave in the South Carolina piedmont in 1777	"The story of Free Frank is not only a testament to human courage and resourcefulness but affords new insight into the American frontier. Born a slave in the South Carolina piedmont in 1777, Frank died a free man in 1854 in a town he had founded in western Illinois. His accomplishments, creditable for any frontiersman, were for a black man extraordinary. We first learn details of Frank's life when in 1795 his owner moved to Pulaski County, Kentucky. We know that he married Lucy, a slave on a neighboring farm, in 1799. Later he was allowed to hire out his time, and when his owner moved to Tennessee, Frank was left in charge of the Kentucky farm. During the War of 1812, he set up his own saltpeter works, an enterprise he maintained until he left Kentucky. In 1817 he purchased his wife's freedom for $800; two years later he bought his own liberty for the same price. Now free, he expanded his activities, purchasing land and dealing in livestock. With his wife and four of his children, Free Frank left Kentucky in 1830 to settle on a new frontier. In Pike County, Illinois, he purchased a farm and later, in 1836, platted and successfully promoted the town of New Philadelphia. The desire for freedom was an obvious spur to his commercial efforts. Through his lifetime of work he purchased the liberty of sixteen members of his family at a cost of nearly $14,000. Goods and services commanded a premium in the life of the frontier. Free Frank's career shows what an exceptional man, through working against great odds, could accomplish through industry, acumen, and aggressiveness. His story suggests a great deal about business activity and legal practices, as well as racial conditions, on the frontier. Juliet Walker has performed a task of historical detection in recreating the life of Free Frank from family traditions, limited personal papers, public documents, and secondary sources. In doing so, she has added a significant chapter to the history of African Americans.",['Juliet E.K.

"The Pancatantra is the most famous collection of fables in India and was one of the earliest Indian books to be translated into Western languages. No other work of Indian literature has had a greater influence on world literature	"The Pancatantra is the most famous collection of fables in India and was one of the earliest Indian books to be translated into Western languages. No other work of Indian literature has had a greater influence on world literature, and no other collection of stories has become as popular in India itself. Patrick Olivelle presents the Pancatantra in all its complexity and rich ambivalence, examining central elements of political and moral philosophy alongside the many controversial issues surrounding its history. This new translation vividly reveals the story-telling powers of the original author, while detailed notes illuminate aspects of ancient Indian society and religion to the non-specialist reader. About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Liefde als het erop aankomt van Daniela Krien vertelt de verhalen van vijf vrouwen die opgroeiden in de DDR en als jongvolwassenen de val van de Muur meemaken. Judith, Brida, Malika en Jorinde zijn volwassen geworden tegen het einde van de ddr en hebben de val van de Muur meegemaakt. Waar eerder grenzen waren, is nu vrijheid. Maar vrijheid is evengoed dwingend. Het dwingt je keuzes te maken. Hun zoektocht naar geluk en liefde hebben de vijf met elkaar gemeen. Maar wat betekent liefde eigenlijk, in deze tijden? Paula ontmoet op een zomeravond haar toekomstige echtgenoot. Ze krijgen een kind, maar dat sterft en hun verdriet is eindeloos. Judith, Paula’s beste vriendin, heeft een bijna meisjesachtig verlangen naar tederheid. Maar dan raakt ze onbedoeld zwanger. Brida is schrijver; een vrouw die laveert tussen het zorgen voorhaar kinderen en haar drang te schrijven. Malika was een talentvolviolist; de hoop op een mooie toekomst vervliegt echter wanneer haar man haar verlaat. Dan doet haar succesvolle zus Jorinde haar een ongehoord aanbod.

"Between 1936 and 1938	"Between 1936 and 1938, some 3,000 young Americans sailed to France and crossed the Pyrenees to take part in the brutal civil war raging in Spain. Virtually all joined the International Brigades, formed under the auspices of the Soviet-led Comintern and largely directed by Communists. Yet a large number were not Communists; their activism was inspired by domestic and international crises of the 1930s, and colored by idealism.The men who went to Spain came out of a radical subculture that emerged from the Depression and the New Deal. Th is radicalism was a native plant, but it was nourished from abroad. In the thirties the menace of fascism seemed to be spreading like cancer across Europe, giving an international aspect to many domestic problems in the United States. To intellectuals, students, unionists, liberals, and leftists, the threat of fascism was so real that many came to believe that if it was not stopped in Spain, eventually they would have to take up arms against fascism at home.To understand the Americans who fought in the Spanish Civil War it is necessary to bury some of the shibboleths of cold war years. Dissidence in the United States occurs in response to perceptions of reality on this side of the Atlantic, not because of the wishes of men in the Soviet Union. Th e members of the Lincoln Battalion were genuine products of America, and their story is properly a page in American military and political history. From them, one can learn much about the world of the 1930s and perhaps even something about the potential of modern man for thought and action in time of crisis.",['Robert Rosenstone'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3PdKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=3PdKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Crusade+of+the+Left:+The+Lincoln+battalion+in+the+Spanish+Civil+War&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2018-02-06,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3PdKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],	R

"This volume brings together Pierre Bourdieu's highly original writings on language and on the relations among language	"This volume brings together Pierre Bourdieu's highly original writings on language and on the relations among language, power, and politics. Bourdieu develops a forceful critique of traditional approaches to language, including the linguistic theories of Saussure and Chomsky and the theory of speech-acts elaborated by Austin and others. He argues that language should be viewed not only as a means of communication but also as a medium of power through which individuals pursue their own interests and display their practical competence. Drawing on the concepts that are part of his distinctive theoretical approach, Bourdieu maintains that linguistic utterances or expressions can be understood as the product of the relation between a ""linguistic market"" and a ""linguistic habitus."" When individuals use language in particular ways, they deploy their accumulated linguistic resources and implicitly adapt their words to the demands of the social field or market that is their audience. Hence every linguistic interaction, however personal or insignificant it may seem, bears the traces of the social structure that it both expresses and helps to reproduce. Bourdieu's account sheds fresh light on the ways in which linguistic usage varies according to considerations such as class and gender. It also opens up a new approach to the ways in which language is used in the domain of politics. For politics is, among other things, the arena in which words are deeds and the symbolic character of power is at stake. This volume, by one of the leading social thinkers in the world today, represents a major contribution to the study of language and power. It will be of interest to students throughout the social sciences and humanities, especially in sociology, politics, anthropology, linguistics, and literature.",['Pierre Bourdieu'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u2ZlGBiJntAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=u2ZlGBiJntAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Language+and+Symbolic+Power&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harvard University Press,1991,http://books.google.nl/books?id=u2ZlGBiJntAC&dq=Language+and+Symbolic+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],3.0	R

"Policymakers and public managers around the world have become preoccupied with the question of how their goals can be achieved in a way that rebuilds public confidence in government.

Yet because public policies and programs increasingly are being administered through a complicated web of jurisdictions, agencies, and public-private partnerships, evaluating their effectiveness is more difficult than in the past. Though social scientists possess insightful theories and powerful methods for conducting empirical research on governance and public management, their work is too often fragmented and irrelevant to the specific tasks faced by legislators, administrators, and managers. Proposing a framework for research based on the premise that any particular governance arrangement is embedded in a wider social, fiscal, and political context, Laurence E. Lynn Jr., Carolyn J. Heinrich, and Carolyn J. Hill argue that theory-based empirical research, when well conceived and executed, can be a primary source of fundamental, durable knowledge about governance and policy management. Focusing on complex human services such as public assistance, child protection, and public education, they construct an integrative, multilevel ""logic of governance,"" that can help researchers increase the sophistication, power, and relevance of their work.","['Laurence E.

"Concerns about rights in the United States have a long history	"Concerns about rights in the United States have a long history, but the articulation of global human rights in the twentieth century was something altogether different. Global human rights offered individuals unprecedented guarantees beyond the nation for the protection of political, economic, social and cultural freedoms. The World Reimagined explores how these revolutionary developments first became believable to Americans in the 1940s and the 1970s through everyday vernaculars as they emerged in political and legal thought, photography, film, novels, memoirs and soundscapes. Together, they offered fundamentally novel ways for Americans to understand what it means to feel free, culminating in today's ubiquitous moral language of human rights. Set against a sweeping transnational canvas, the book presents a new history of how Americans thought and acted in the twentieth-century world.",['Mark Philip Bradley'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6zn7DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6zn7DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA258&dq=Reporting+World+War+II+Part+Two:+American+Journalism+1944-46&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cambridge University Press,2016-09-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6zn7DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],	R

 Treatment	 Treatment, and Options","Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer in the U.S., with over 170,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Despite this, it receives little attention from the media and little sympathy from the public. Those with lung cancer suffer more blame and stigma than other cancer patients, even though 50 percent of them are former smokers or have never smoked. Treatments for lung cancer can significantly impact quality of life, and the prognosis for some types and stages of lung cancer, using standard treatments, can be daunting. In straightforward language,Lung Cancer: Making Sense of Diagnosis, Treatment & Optionsaddresses medical, emotional, and support needs, often in the words of patients and families themselves. Topics include: Diagnosis and medical tests Characteristics of the lung cancers, factors in prognosis, and the various subtypes and staging systems for the disease Treatments, including standard treatments for the subtypes, as well as emerging research and promising treatments now in clinical trials Side effects and long-term effects of treatment, including how to cope and how to improve quality of life Emotional responses to diagnosis, treatment, remission, possible recurrence, and other aspects of dealing with the condition, including stories from dozens of families living with lung cancer Getting support from family, friends, employers, and the broader community Comprehensive list of lung cancer resources: organizations, print, online sites Other resources, including a pull-out Cancer Survivor's Treatment Record, glossary, bibliography, and technical appendices Author and patient advocate Lorraine Johnston, with her background in life sciences, emphasizes using knowledge to dispel fear.

 1890-1960: Gender	 1890-1960: Gender, Class and Ethnicity","Integrating a variety of historical approaches and methods, Joanna Bourke looks at the construction of class within the intimate contexts of the body, the home, the marketplace, the locality and the nation to assess how the subjective identity of the 'working class' in Britain has been maintained through seventy years of radical social, cultural and economic change. She argues that class identity is essentially a social and cultural rather than an institutional or political phenomenon and therefore cannot be understood without constant reference to gender and ethnicity.

There's a killer on the loose, and the show's look-alikes are being murdered. What twisted motive lies behind the killings? Ellie's dying to see the ending of this serial killer's saga...

 Learning	 Learning, and Improvement","If you are: overwhelmed by the amount of change and the difficulty in making it happen, finding failure - or limited success - with the implementation of changes, disappointed in the growth or financial performance of your organization, and are looking for a strategy for improving your organization's capacity for planned and proactive change, this book is for you. The world is continuing to change at a rapid pace, while most organizations are focused on maintaining stability and certainty. The price of this growing gap is the diversion of limited resources to reactive, fire-fighting behaviors and the inability to lead and be proactive. Allowing the gap to continue to grow is the formula for failure, this book gives you the formula for success. In The EverChanging Organization, the authors present a model of the EverChanging Organization(ECO). This is a systems model for understanding an organization's needed capacity for change in a range of change orientations from change averse to change seeking. The book includes diagnostic scales, tools for assessing need and status as an ECO, and a process for selecting and implementing change initiatives to achieve the needed capacity for change in timely and cost effective ways.",['Gerald R Pieters'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BRwuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BRwuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Ever+Changing+Organization:+Creating+the+Capacity+for+Continuous+Change,+Learning,+and+Improvement&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Routledge,2017-07-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BRwuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],	R

"Earn-lay atin-Lay? No	"Earn-lay atin-Lay? No, not that kind of Latin! You can learn true Latin, with conjugations, declensions, and all those extra syllables – and it’s easier than you think. In fact, most people mistakenly think of learning Latin as perhaps the most useless, tedious, and difficult thing to do on earth. They couldn’t be more wrong. Latin For Dummies takes you back for a quick jaunt through the parlance of ancient Rome, as well as discussing the progress of Latin into church language, and its status today as the “dead” language that lives on in English, Spanish, Italian, and most other Western tongues. Written for those with zero prior knowledge of Latin, this snappy guide puts the basics at your fingertips and steers clear of the arcane, schoolmarm stereotype of endless declensions and Herculean translations. Easy-to-understand sections describe: Latin you already know Grammar Pronunciation Latin in action Latin in law Latin in medicine Latin for impressing your friends And much more No dusty tome or other such artifact, Latin For Dummies makes learning fun and brings the language to life by presenting conversations in various Roman settings, as well as providing fun facts and stories about classical life. And if you feel you may actually have a negative aptitude for the language, don’t worry; pronunciations and translations follow every expression, and a helpful mini-dictionary graces the book’s last pages. You’ll also find out about: The quotable Roman Latin graffiti Latin authors who’s who Gladiator Latin Latin in love, marriage, and family From the mouth of Julius Caesar Romans on drink Helpful Latin-related Web sites Fun and games exercises Designed to introduce and familiarize you with the language rather than make you the next Cicero, Latin For Dummies gives you all the tools you need to work at your own pace to learn as much or as little as you like.

James, a vampire, can make Poppy immortal, but first they must risk everything to go against the laws of Night World. Three fugitive vampire sisters leave their isolated homes to live among humans in Daughters of Darkness.

"Go to any unpopulated or abandoned area in any given urban setting	"Go to any unpopulated or abandoned area in any given urban setting, and you'll find them. Thousands and thousands of wild dogs-abandoned to disease, starvation, and inevitable death-are leading short and brutal lives in the no-man's-land between domestication and wildness, byproducts of the human destitution around them. A lucky few are saved by dedicated rescuers, and Randy Grim, has emerged as one of the country's leading dog saviors. After years of rescuing dogs on his own, he founded Stray Rescue of St. Louis, an organization dedicated to rescue and rehabilitation. These are dogs that belong to no one, the ones animal-control experts can't catch and humane shelters won't deal with. They are stray or feral, either abandoned or born wild on the streets, which means they won't come near humans and statistically won't live past their second year. And their numbers are growing every day.

The thick, cloying blanket of afternoon heat spread itself drowsily across the Umbrian landscape, leaving the earth scorched under a sun-bleached sky. On far-off mountaintops storms were brewing and distant thunder seemed to rise from a sunstruck earth, an incantation from other times. We drove on and on in a trance towards the hill town of Trevi, only casting aside weariness with the excitement of seeing our new home again. The recently acquired object of our desires was an abandoned olive mill clinging to the edge of tree-lined slopes on the outskirts of the town, purchased quite impulsively the previous summer.""",['Virginia Ryan'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4kVIjddzRTMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=4kVIjddzRTMC&pg=PA38&dq=Where+the+Cypress+Rises&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Strictly Literary,2008,http://books.google.nl/books?id=4kVIjddzRTMC&dq=Where+the+Cypress+Rises&hl=&source=gbs_api,"['Artists, Australian']",	R

He taught Tiger Woods through one of the greatest stretches of victories in golf history (and, perhaps even more conspicuously, did not teach Tiger Woods following his unprecedented run), as well as superstars like Greg Norman, Adam Scott, Fred Couples, Darren Clarke, Natalie Gulbis, and Davis Love III. How did he become such a legendary teacher and mentor? The answer is simple: He learned from watching his father. The Harmons are the First Family of golf, and Claude Harmon, Sr., was the greatest of them all. His skill as a player, an innovator, a teacher, a devoted father, a loyal friend, and a peer of giants such as Ben Hogan has gone largely unappreciated by all but those who knew him best. In this book by his son, he finally gets his due. In The Pro, Butch Harmon paints a compelling portrait of an era in sports before the emergence of big media and bigger money, and shows how the lessons he learned about life and golf at his father’s knee made him the man he is today. The Pro is both a family and a golf memoir, as well as an inside look at what it takes to teach the Tigers of the world. It describes how Butch and his brothers, who are also teachers, transfer their father’s unique wit, wisdom, and philosophy to the next generation of golfers. Sometimes their advice relates to the game, sometimes they simply offer words of encouragement and motivation, sometimes they make pointed criticisms intended to shock their students into focus, and sometimes they try to impart simple advice about “walking around through life.” The Harmon brothers are teachers who share a special quality: All of their lessons are passed down from their father. Millions of golf fans know Butch Harmon; many are even familiar with his father and brothers. But never before have we been given such an intimate look at life among the legends of golf. The Pro is the story of an extraordinary father and son that will resonate with anyone who has ever looked back on life and recognized the wisdom of their parents’ teachings. ""Golf's hard,"" Dad would say, pointing a meaty finger at me as if he were about to reveal the secret of the Rosetta Stone. “Good golf is damn hard, and championship golf is something only a few will ever see. But that’s how it should be. If it were easy, everybody would do it. And where’s the fun in that?” From Butch Harmon, the world’s number one golf coach, comes the inside story of how he learned everything he knows about golf and life from his father, Claude Harmon, Sr. Both a family memoir and a reminiscence of growing up among the legends of sport, The Pro is a portrait of one extraordinary family and the game that will carry their legacy for years to come.",['Butch Harmon'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zJf8OcVoBNYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=zJf8OcVoBNYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Pro:+Lessons+from+My+Father+About+Golf+and+Life&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Crown,2006-05-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zJf8OcVoBNYC&source=gbs_api,['Sports & Recreation'],	R

"In Wallace Stevens: A Poet’s Growth	"In Wallace Stevens: A Poet’s Growth, George S. Lensing examines Stevens’ gradual emergence and development as a poet, tracing his life from his formative years in Pennsylvania to his careers as a lawyer for the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company and as one of the major poets of the twentieth century. Lensing draws extensively upon previously unpublished material from the Stevens archive at the Huntington Library, which contains letters, early drafts of poems, and notebooks. Two notebooks,Schemata and From Pieces of Paper, are here reproduced in full. The study is divided into three sections. In the first, Lensing examines the years before the publication of Sevens’ first volume of poetry, paying special attention to the forces that hindered and enhanced his progress toward modernity. In the second, we see Stevens in the exercise of his craft. Lensing discusses the influence of the Romantics on the verse Stevens wrote as an undergraduate at Harvard; his interest in Oriental art, Cubism, and Fauvism; his anticipation of Imagism; and his imitation of certain French Symbolists. Sources of the epigraphs to Stevens’ poems are identified fully for the first time, suggesting the role of Stevens’ vast reading upon his poetry. Also considered is Stevens’ voluminous correspondence with people from all over the world, some of whom he never met personally. These letters helped rescue Stevens from the insularity of his business life and aided in the making of his poems. The final section treats the critical responses to Stevens’ poetry by such people as Harriet Monroe, editor and founder of Poetry, who was the first important reader and publisher of his work. Attention is also given to Stevens’ explications of his poems. Wallace Stevens: A Poet’s Growth is a comprehensive examination of Stevens’ live and work. This study provides abundant new material, which will be of value to scholars and to those readers who are drawn to Stevens’ poetry.",['George S.

His fame was such that news of his death vied with the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima in the US press, his legendary exploits at the helm of his P-38 Lightning had made him a household name. Bong had only recently received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his exploits of downing 40 enemy Japanese planes in the Southwestern Pacific. His tally of 40 victories made him the highest scoring American ace of all time, a record that is unlikely to ever be broken. In this biography his former commanding officer General George C.

Has the newness worn off so much so that you dread going to work every day? Have you ever felt as if your tasks––whether in a big organization or at home––just didn’t really contribute to anything significant? Do you often speculate about how much more influence you could have if you worked in a more visible or critical role––like may be a doctor, a pastor, a congressional representative? If so, then this book will inspire you to take a more reflective look at where you work, how you work, and who you influence. You’ll explore challenges such as these: · Finding the right job · Finding your calling in life · How to find purpose in life · Doing your best at work and what that looks like practically speaking As a companion to the earlier book Your Signature Life by the same author, Your Signature Work expands on the concept of doing your personal best at work so that it reflects your goals, values, beliefs, and faith. Using a sports analogy (basketball), this companion book will challenge you to see your tasks and job—whether parenting, building a forklift, stocking shelves, selling pharmaceuticals, or analyzing computer glitches––as an opportunity for leadership and service to others. As you strive for personal excellence, you'll identify ways to influence others in your workplace to “live” their values and faith. Even if you feel trapped in a dissatisfying job or a seemingly insignificant career, your work matters to God and to others in need. Your attitude can make all the difference in how you view your job, and the results you achieve! When you find your true calling, your work will be a source of satisfaction and fulfillment. And as an artist does, you will be proud to sign your name to work!

"Stephen King	"Stephen King, Over leven en schrijven `Een meesterverteller.' VPRO Gids `Hoe doet King dat toch?' vroeg Joost Zwagerman zich al af in de Volkskrant. Hoe slaagt King er toch telkens weer in zijn lezers aan zich te binden en ze te verrassen? Hierover gaat Over leven en schrijven. Stephen King verhaalt over zijn jeugd, zijn puberjaren en zijn studietijd. Over de jaren na zijn doorbraak als schrijver, met Carrie, waarin succes en stress hem achtervolgen en de drank een uitvlucht biedt. Over het ongeluk dat hem in 1999 bijna het leven kost. En hoe hij er weer bovenop komt door zijn onweerstaanbare drang tot schrijven. Over wat hem inspireert en hoe hij te werk gaat. En natuurlijk laat King zijn licht schijnen over het belangrijkste wapen van elke schrijver: de pen die de auteur altijd in de aanslag moet hebben. Over leven en schrijven is een bron van inspiratie, voor zowel lezers als (aspirant-)schrijvers. Stephen King (1947) heeft meer dan tweehonderd verhalen op zijn naam staan, waaronder vijftig thriller- en fantasy-titels, alle wereldwijde bestsellers, waaronder Under the Dome (Gevangen), 22-11-1963, De Donkere Toren-reeks, Joyland,De Shining en Dr. Sleep.",['Stephen King'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UGEtDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=UGEtDgAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=THE+ELEMENTS+OF+STYLE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Luitingh Sijthoff,2013-10-31,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UGEtDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],	R

Venus Johnston has a great job, a beautiful home, and a loving live-in boyfriend named Clint, who happens to be a drop-dead gorgeous doctor. She also has a weekly beauty-parlor date with Tina, who keeps Venus's long, processed hair slick and straight. But when Clint--who's been reluctant to commit over the past four years--brings home a puppy instead of an engagement ring, Venus decides to give it all up. She trades in her long hair for a dramatically short, natural cut and sends Clint packing. It's a bold declaration of independence--one that has effects she never could have imagined. Reactions from friends and coworkers range from concern to contempt to outright condemnation. And when Clint moves on and starts dating a voluptuous, long-haired beauty, Venus is forced to question what she really wants out of life. With wit, resilience, and a lot of determination, she finally learns what true happiness is--on her own terms.

 Bad Muslim: America	 Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","In this brilliant look at the rise of political Islam, the distinguished political scientist and anthropologist Mahmood Mamdani brings his expertise and insight to bear on a question many Americans have been asking since 9/11: how did this happen? Mamdani dispels the idea of “good” (secular, westernized) and “bad” (premodern, fanatical) Muslims, pointing out that these judgments refer to political rather than cultural or religious identities. The presumption that there are “good” Muslims readily available to be split off from “bad” Muslims masks a failure to make a political analysis of our times. This book argues that political Islam emerged as the result of a modern encounter with Western power, and that the terrorist movement at the center of Islamist politics is an even more recent phenomenon, one that followed America’s embrace of proxy war after its defeat in Vietnam. Mamdani writes with great insight about the Reagan years, showing America’s embrace of the highly ideological politics of “good” against “evil.” Identifying militant nationalist governments as Soviet proxies in countries such as Nicaragua and Afghanistan, the Reagan administration readily backed terrorist movements, hailing them as the “moral equivalents” of America’s Founding Fathers. The era of proxy wars has come to an end with the invasion of Iraq. And there, as in Vietnam, America will need to recognize that it is not fighting terrorism but nationalism, a battle that cannot be won by occupation. Good Muslim, Bad Muslim is a provocative and important book that will profoundly change our understanding both of Islamist politics and the way America is perceived in the world today.",['Mahmood Mamdani'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W69rBkP3W7QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=W69rBkP3W7QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Good+Muslim,+Bad+Muslim:+America,+the+Cold+War,+and+the+Roots+of+Terror&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Harmony,2005-06-21,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W69rBkP3W7QC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],4.0	R
"First contact with extraordinary aliens	"First contact with extraordinary aliens, glittering technologies that could destroy the universe in a nanosecond, huge sweeping space operas: Alastair Reynolds is back! Some centuries from now, the exploration and exploitation of the Solar System is in full swing. On the cold edge of the system, Bella Lind, captain of the huge commercial spacecraft Rockhopper IV, helps fuel this new gold rush by attaching mass-driver motors to organic-rich water-ice comets to move them back to the inner worlds. Her crew are tough, blue-collar miners, engineers and demolition experts. Around Saturn, something inexplicable happens: one of the moons leaves its orbit and accelerates out of the Solar System. The icy mantle peels away to reveal that it was never a moon in the first place, just a parked spacecraft, millions of years old, that has now decided to move on. Rockhopper IV, trapped in the pull, is hurled across time and space into the deep, distant future, arriving in a vast, alien-constructed chamber. And the crew are not alone, for each chamber contains an alien culture dragged into this cosmic menagerie at the end of time. The crew of the Rockhopper IV know a lot about blowing up comets, but not much about first contact with ultra-advanced aliens. They have two things to worry about: can they (and their new alien allies) negotiate their way through each harrying contact? And can they assimilate the avalanche of knowledge about their own future - including all the glittering, dangerous technologies that are now theirs for the taking - without destroying themselves in the process?",['Alastair Reynolds'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u8GGpHHG_kkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=u8GGpHHG_kkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Pushing+Ice&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Hachette UK,2009-12-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u8GGpHHG_kkC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],29.0	R

"Essential reading for anyone interested in the most famous American crime of the twentieth century Since its original publication in 2004	"Essential reading for anyone interested in the most famous American crime of the twentieth century Since its original publication in 2004, The Case That Never Dies has become the standard account of the Lindbergh Kidnapping. Now, in a new afterword, historian Lloyd C. Gardner presents a surprise conclusion based on recently uncovered pieces of evidence that were missing from the initial investigation as well as an evaluation of Charles Lindbergh’s role in the search for the kidnappers. Out of the controversies surrounding the actions of Colonel Lindbergh, Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the New Jersey State Police, and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, Gardner presents a well-reasoned argument for what happened on the night of March 1, 1932. The Case That NeverDies places the Lindbergh kidnapping, investigation, and trial in the context of the Depression, when many feared the country was on the edge of anarchy. Gardner delves deeply into the aspects of the case that remain confusing to this day, including Lindbergh’s dealings with crime baron Owney Madden, Al Capone’s New York counterpart, as well as the inexplicable exploits of John Condon, a retired schoolteacher who became the prosecution’s best witness. The initial investigation was hampered by Colonel Lindbergh, who insisted that the police not attempt to find the perpetrator because he feared the investigation would endanger his son’s life. He relented only when the child was found dead. After two years of fruitless searching, Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a German immigrant, was discovered to have some of the ransom money in his possession. Hauptmann was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death. Throughout the book, Gardner pays special attention to the evidence of the case and how it was used and misused in the trial. Whether Hauptmann was guilty or not, Gardner concludes that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of first-degree murder. Set in historical context, the book offers not only a compelling read, but a powerful vantage point from which to observe the United States in the 1930s as well as contemporary arguments over capital punishment.",['Lloyd Gardner'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yyDXhhNjkYwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=yyDXhhNjkYwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Case+That+Never+Dies:+The+Lindbergh+Kidnapping&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Rutgers University Press,2012-06-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yyDXhhNjkYwC&source=gbs_api,['History'],	R

"A collection of essays that “do an incredible job of balancing the wonders and horrors of the force that is Wal-Mart” (Booklist	"A collection of essays that “do an incredible job of balancing the wonders and horrors of the force that is Wal-Mart” (Booklist, starred review). Edited by one of the nation’s preeminent labor historians, this book marks an ambitious effort to dissect the full extent of Wal-Mart’s business operations, its social effects, and its role in the United States and world economy. Wal-Mart is based on a spring 2004 conference of leading historians, business analysts, sociologists, and labor leaders that immediately attracted the attention of the national media, drawing profiles in the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and the New York Review of Books. Their contributions are adapted here for a general audience. At the end of the nineteenth century, the Pennsylvania Railroad declared itself “the standard of the world.” In more recent years, IBM and then Microsoft seemed the template for a new, global information economy. But at the dawn of the twenty-first century, Wal-Mart had overtaken all rivals as the world-transforming economic institution of our time. Presented in an accessible format and extensively illustrated with charts and graphs, Wal-Mart examines such topics as the giant retailer’s managerial culture, revolutionary use of technological innovation, and controversial pay and promotional practices to provide the most complete guide yet available to one of America’s largest companies. “Like archaeologists who pick over artifacts to understand an ancient society, the scholars here [are] examining Wal-Mart for insights into the very nature of American capitalist culture.” —The New York Times “Stimulating perspectives on the world’s largest corporation.” —Publishers Weekly",['Nelson Lichtenstein'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OEqdL9wZMuIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=OEqdL9wZMuIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Wal-Mart:+The+Face+of+Twenty-First-Century+Capitalism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,The New Press,2016-02-02,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OEqdL9wZMuIC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],	R

Volume One covers Biological/Evolutionary Level of Analysis, Cognitive Level of Analysis, Content Model and Motivational and Affective Level of Analysis. Authored by leading international experts, each chapter represents a personal and historical narrative of the theory’s development including the inspirations, critical junctures, and problem-solving efforts that effected theoretical choices and determined the theory’s impact and its evolution. Unique to this handbook, these narratives provide a rich background for understanding how theories are created, nurtured, and shaped over time, and examining their unique contribution to the field as a whole. To examine its societal impact, each theory is evaluated in terms of its applicability to better understanding and solving critical social issues and problems.

Well bypass the city gates, answered Saul calmly. Just let me explain. What did Saul have in mind? Would it be dangerous? And would it work? This book tells what happened.

"Japanese POW camp Changi	"Japanese POW camp Changi, Singapore: hell on earth for the soldiers contained within its barbed wire walls. Officers and enlisted men, all prisoners together, yet the old hierarchies and rivalries survive. An American corporal, known as the King, has used his personality and wiles to facilitate trading with guards and locals to get needed food, supplies, even information into the camp. The imprisoned upper-class officers have never had to do things for themselves, and now they are reduced to wearing rags while the King’s clean shirt, gained through guts and moxie, seems like luxury in comparison. In the camp, everything has its price and everything is for sale. But trading is illegal—and the King has made a formidable enemy. Robin Grey, the provost marshal, hates the King and all he represents. Grey, though he grew up modestly, fervently believes in the British class system: everyone should know their place, and he knows the King’s place is at the bottom. The King does have a friend in Peter Marlowe, who, though wary of the King and himself a product of the British system, finds himself drawn to the charismatic man who just might be the only one who can save them from both the inhumanity of the prison camp but also from themselves. Powerful and engrossing, King Rat artfully weaves the author’s own World War II prison camp experiences into a compelling narrative of survival amidst the grim realities of war and what men can do when pushed to the edge.

"The Mass in My Life is the story of a Catholic laywoman's lifelong experience of the Mass. She recaptures childhood experiences	"The Mass in My Life is the story of a Catholic laywoman's lifelong experience of the Mass. She recaptures childhood experiences, traces a path to adulthood, and in her elder years finds a wondrous gratitude for the Mass. Along the way, family, friends, pastors, favorite authors, and the Mass itself lighten her way as she seeks, in the words of an old missal, ""the God who is the joy of my youth."" Personal and family memories are recalled side-by-side with selected prayers of the Mass from her collection of missals that covers seven decades. The meaning of the Mass unfolds as the years go by, marked by ordinary days as well as rites of passage. Each chapter focuses on a milestone or period in the author's life and a prayer from the Order of the Mass. The two themes, life and Mass, interweave chronologically in a unique twofold structure. There are rich and sometimes troubling memories of personal and family life here, but always an attentive longing for the Mass which the author sees as the transforming experience of her life.",['Rosemary Lunardini'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wvvrVJ53nk4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=wvvrVJ53nk4C&pg=PT148&dq=My+mass&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,iUniverse,2009-01-17,http://books.google.nl/books?id=wvvrVJ53nk4C&dq=My+mass&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],	R

"PREFACE. THE Author of this very practical treatise on Scotch Loch - Fishing desires clearly that it may be of use to all who had it. He does not pretend to have written anything new	"PREFACE. THE Author of this very practical treatise on Scotch Loch - Fishing desires clearly that it may be of use to all who had it. He does not pretend to have written anything new, but to have attempted to put what he has to say in as readable a form as possible. Everything in the way of the history and habits of fish has been studiously avoided, and technicalities have been used as sparingly as possible. The writing of this book has afforded him pleasure in his leisure moments, and that pleasure would be much increased if he knew that the perusal of it would create any bond of sympathy between himself and the angling community in general. This section is interleaved with blank shects for the readers notes. The Author need hardly say that any suggestions addressed to the case of the publishers, will meet with consideration in a future edition. We do not pretend to write or enlarge upon a new subject. Much has been said and written-and well said and written too on the art of fishing but loch-fishing has been rather looked upon as a second-rate performance, and to dispel this idea is one of the objects for which this present treatise has been written. Far be it from us to say anything against fishing, lawfully practised in any form but many pent up in our large towns will bear us out when me say that, on the whole, a days loch-fishing is the most convenient. One great matter is, that the loch-fisher is depend- ent on nothing but enough wind to curl the water, -and on a large loch it is very seldom that a dead calm prevails all day, -and can make his arrangements for a day, weeks beforehand whereas the stream- fisher is dependent for a good take on the state of the water and however pleasant and easy it may be for one living near the banks of a good trout stream or river, it is quite another matter to arrange for a days river-fishing, if one is looking forward to a holiday at a date some weeks ahead. Providence may favour the expectant angler with a good day, and the water in order but experience has taught most of us that the good days are in the minority, and that, as is the case with our rapid running streams, -such as many of our northern streams are, -the water is either too large or too small, unless, as previously remarked, you live near at hand, and can catch it at its best. A common belief in regard to loch-fishing is, that the tyro and the experienced angler have nearly the same chance in fishing, -the one from the stern and the other from the bow of the same boat. Of all the absurd beliefs as to loch-fishing, this is one of the most absurd. Try it. Give the tyro either end of the boat he likes give him a cast of ally flies he may fancy, or even a cast similar to those which a crack may be using and if he catches one for every three the other has, he may consider himself very lucky. Of course there are lochs where the fish are not abundant, and a beginner may come across as many as an older fisher but we speak of lochs where there are fish to be caught, and where each has a fair chance. Again, it is said that the boatman has as much to do with catching trout in a loch as the angler. Well, we dont deny that. In an untried loch it is necessary to have the guidance of a good boatman but the same argument holds good as to stream-fishing...",['Dumas Malone'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M18UambLINQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=M18UambLINQC&dq=What+Would+Jefferson+Say%3F&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Warren Press,2007-03,http://books.google.nl/books?id=M18UambLINQC&dq=What+Would+Jefferson+Say%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],	R

Attention is paid to step-by-step guidance through the many stages of the process. A detailed manual of technique, Copper Plate Photogravure also offers the history of the medium and reference to past alternative methods of practice. Copper Plate Photogravure: Demystifying the Process is part of the current revitalization of one of the most satisfyingly beautiful image-making processes. The range of ink color and paper quality possibilities is endless. The potential for handwork and alteration of the copper plate provides yet another realm of expressive variation. The subject matter and the treatment are as variable and broad as photography itself. This book's purpose is to demystify and clarify what is a complex but altogether ""do-able"" photomechanical process using currently available materials. With Copper Plate Photogravure, you will learn how to: · produce a full-scale film positive from a photographic negative · sensitize the gravure tissue to prepare it for exposure to the positive · prepare the plate and develop the gelatin resist prior to etching · prepare the various strengths of etching solutions and etch the plate to achieve a full tonal scale · rework the plate using printmaking tools to correct flaws or to adjust the image for aesthetic reasons · use the appropriate printing inks, ink additives, quality papers, and printshop equipment to produce a high quality print A historical survey and appendices of detailed technical information, charts, and tables are included, as well as a list of suppliers and sources for the materials required, some of which are highly specialized.

Thus begins a story of humor	"A young American infantryman finds himself in a Korean troop train hurrying north to the front early in 1953. Thus begins a story of humor, pathos, horror, bitterness, and a chilling look at the class discrimination–whether intended or accidental–that created a warrior class of poor, uneducated men to fight a vicious enemy in a forlorn, inhospitable country. Later, this soldier’s epiphany comes from the lips of one of his beloved comrades, and creates the metaphor for much of the harrowing journey that is The Gnashing of Teeth. You will be witness to his growth, agonizing choices and painful search for redemption where little was forthcoming. Love also finds its way into this novel, beginning and ending in unlikely and sometimes heart-rending circumstances. Whether or not this soldier survives his journey is a growing concern readers will not satisfy until the very last words of this epic.

After two failed attempts to flee--each bringing severe beatings and death threats--Francis finally escaped at age seventeen.

"The Tiger Moth is one of the major aviation success stories in the history of British aviation. Developed by Geoffrey de Havilland and flown for the first time on October 26 1931	"The Tiger Moth is one of the major aviation success stories in the history of British aviation. Developed by Geoffrey de Havilland and flown for the first time on October 26 1931, the biplane became the most important elementary trainer used by Commonwealth forces. More than 1,000 Tiger Moths were delivered before WWII, and subsequently around 4,000 were built in the UK with an extra 2,000 being manufactured in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Following the end of WWII, pilots could buy and modify a Tiger Moth for recreational use or agricultural crop spraying and use it relatively cheaply. This, combined with its popularity within the aero club movement, provided employment for the Tiger Moths until the late fifties when the more modern closed cockpit aircraft began to force them into retirement. This new paperback edition provides a comprehensive account of the aircraft origins and its development as a trainer of Commonwealth pilots in times of peace and war. It also looks at some of the other roles which this versatile little aeroplane performed such as a crop duster, glider tug, aerial advertiser, bomber, coastal patrol plane and aerial ambulance. Technical narrative and drawings, handling ability and performance as seen through the eyes of the pilots to make The Tiger Moth Story the most comprehensive book of the aircraft.",['A.

"This book is a series of reflections about the journey of mankind toward their God	"This book is a series of reflections about the journey of mankind toward their God, whether they believe or not. It is dedicated to the struggle of all who live their lives with love for their neighbor and do the best they can with what they are given. It is further dedicated to those non-believers who live a life of goodness with real concern for their fellow man. We are all on a journey, whether we want to admit it or not. We only have so much time to accomplish what needs to be done. But in the end, only one thing matters. We are to be united with our loving God for all eternity. The bulk of the book concerns the promise that America holds for all people. In no way are the reflections intended to belittle any group that is true and honest in their efforts to help its followers achieve the goal of unity with God. The intention of the author is to provide some insight to the problems we face as a people. The problems are many, but first and foremost we must have the same interests for others that we have for ourselves. All of the problems we face have the same root. Thus far in our civilizations we have had much education and instruction. Much of this knowledge has lead to misunderstanding and has not addressed the root of our problems. The root is that we are not capable to love others as we love ourselves. If we do not address the root of the problem, then we will not be better off tomorrow than we are today or were yesterday. ‘NOTHING WILL CHANGE FOR THE BETTER’.",['Vicktor Barrios'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vaYda8s4MbEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=vaYda8s4MbEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=From+Fear+to+Hope&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Author House,2012-01-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vaYda8s4MbEC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],	R
"The eighteenth century Irish philosopher George Berkeley is best known for his empiricist and idealist philosophy	"The eighteenth century Irish philosopher George Berkeley is best known for his empiricist and idealist philosophy, which argues that reality consists only of minds and their ideas. He is also known for his critique of abstraction, an important premise in his argument for immaterialism.

"Released in 1952	"Released in 1952, The Anthology of American Folk Music was the singular vision of the enigmatic artist, musicologist, and collector Harry Smith (1923–1991). A collection of eighty-four commercial recordings of American vernacular and folk music originally issued between 1927 and 1932, the Anthology featured an eclectic and idiosyncratic mixture of blues and hillbilly songs, ballads old and new, dance music, gospel, and numerous other performances less easy to classify. Where previous collections of folk music, both printed and recorded, had privileged field recordings and oral transmission, Smith purposefully shaped his collection from previously released commercial records, pointedly blurring established racial boundaries in his selection and organisation of performances. Indeed, more than just a ground-breaking collection of old recordings, the Anthology was itself a kind of performance on the part of its creator. Over the six decades of its existence, however, it has continued to exert considerable influence on generations of musicians, artists, and writers. It has been credited with inspiring the North American folk revival—""The Anthology was our bible"", asserted Dave Van Ronk in 1991, ""We all knew every word of every song on it""—and with profoundly influencing Bob Dylan. After its 1997 release on CD by Smithsonian Folkways, it came to be closely associated with the so-called Americana and Alt-Country movements of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Following its sixtieth birthday, and now available as a digital download and rereleased on vinyl, it is once again a prominent icon in numerous musical currents and popular culture more generally. This is the first book devoted to such a vital piece of the large and complex story of American music and its enduring value in American life. Reflecting the intrinsic interdisciplinarity of Smith’s original project, this collection contains a variety of new perspectives on all aspects of the Anthology.","['Ross Hair', 'Thomas Ruys Smith']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u2GuDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=u2GuDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Anthology+of+American+Folk+Music&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2016-12-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u2GuDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Music'],	R

"In 1938	"In 1938, Thomas Gilcrease, a native of Tulsa, Oklahoma, opened the first museum devoted to the art of the American West. A true visionary, Gilcrease was ahead of his time in understanding the importance of America’s own heritage. His passion for art and history, his Native American ancestry, and his oil revenues coincided in a rare alignment. His legacy is an astounding collection of paintings, sculptures, artifacts, rare books, and documents. This lavishly produced book, featuring nearly two hundred color reproductions, tells the story of Gilcrease and of the renowned museum that bears his name. Compiled by the museum’s curators, Treasures of Gilcrease exemplifies the beauty and breadth of the museum’s resources. The fine art collection alone boasts more than 10,000 American works, ranging in styles from classical to romantic to impressionist and by such master artists as George Catlin, Charles M. Russell, Thomas Moran, and Frederic Remington. The works by Native artists also span styles ranging from painted hides to twentieth-century flat-style. The artifacts—300,000-plus pieces housed in the galleries and vaults—include ceramics, clothing, pipes, and objects of utility, ceremony, and ornamentation.

"\The pre-eminent American slave narrative. Published in 1845	"\The pre-eminent American slave narrative. Published in 1845, this autobiography powerfully details the life of the internationally famous abolitionist Frederick Douglass from his birth into slavery in 1818 to his escape to the North in 1838 - how he endured the daily physical and spiritual brutalities of his owners and drivers, how he learned to read and write, and how he grew into a man who could only live free or die. In his introduction, Houston A. Baker, Jr., discusses the slave narrative as a distinct American literary genre and points out its social, political, historical, and literary significance, past and present.

Using celebrity busts, outrageous everyman busts, and the author's professional experience, Busted! is everything you need to know about the criminal justice system, Drug War style, before it's too late. Like a Law & Order episode, the book takes the reader through a typical small-time drug possession case from committing the crime (the buy/recommending a dealer), to handling police encounters like a pro, to getting busted, to spending a night in jail, to fighting your drug bust, to pleading guilty, through trials and appeals, and, finally, punishment - with irreverent humor and expert advice all the way to the bitter end. Busted! also includes drug possession law for the house party, the rave, your roommate's stash; search and seizure on the street, in your ride, in your apartment, and up your ass. Drug War Driving Lessons covers DUI's and drugged driving; also learn how to make your phone call from jail count, how to ace your bail hearing, and protect your Internet privacy.

A member of the prominent Sinkler family of Charleston and Philadelphia, Elizabeth ""Lizzie"" Sinkler married into Philadelphia's wealthy Coxe family in 1870. Widowed just three years later, she dedicated herself to a lifelong pursuit of philanthropy, intellectual endeavor, and extensive travel.

The Coxes not only visited the sites and monuments of ancient civilizations but also participated in digs, funded entire expeditions, and ultimately subsidized the creation of the Coxe Wing of Ancient History at the University of Pennsylvania Museum. A prolific correspondent, Lizzie conscientiously recorded her adventures abroad in lively prose that captures the surreal exhilarations and harsh realities of traversing the known and barely known worlds of Africa and the Middle East.

"Militant extremists from opposite ends of the political spectrum have radical plans to change America	"Militant extremists from opposite ends of the political spectrum have radical plans to change America, and they are not above taking innocent life to achieve their goals. But, each faction stands in the way of the other and each plans to eliminate the opposition. Mischievous fate, however, has dealt both factions a wild card and one of the leaders may have to commit suicide to stop an even greater evil from arising. The decision must be made before the coming eclipse of the Harvest Moon, unless Ludwig Von Dracula, claiming descent from his infamous namesake, can find a solution to stop the bloodshed. The action builds towards a twisting set of plot turns and shifting fortunes as various actors review their moral options and ethical obligations. A rollicking thriller that combines the traditional werewolf/vampire horror story with the political suspense novel, War of the Werewolf challenges the reader to rethink many cherished principles about right and wrong, good and evil. On the surface, it tells of the conflict between two violent radicals from opposite ends of the political spectrum. As the reader digs deeper, the story turns on decisions about making ethical choices involving life and death. How far will you go to stop a great evil from occurring? Would you willingly take innocent life to promote a socially just revolution? Would you sacrifice your own life for the greater good? Or, would you step aside and let matters take their natural course while you watch from a safe and distant vantage point? These are choices confronting several characters in the story. A fundamental question facing the reader is whom to root for and whom to despise. Who are the heroes and who are the villains? Where you stand on the political spectrum may effect your initial decisions, but as the story reveals more of the characters' actions and motives, you may find your allegiances fading or shifting. Major and secondary characters in this novel include: Alex Mallum, a left-wing radical, who believes that a right-wing media conspiracy distracts viewers from serious discussion of widespread social injustice. He had been married to Danielle Dante, the beautiful feminist writer. When she divorced him under humiliating circumstances, his life fell apart. On the run from the law and from a vicious California mobster, he stopped overnight at the Pentagram Pub, where sick with fever he believed he was attacked by a raging she-beast. Ever since that night he has suffered frequent blackouts and strange dreams about stalking wolves. Subsequently he went underground in New York where he fell in with CRUSH, a hapless band of wannabe urban terrorists seeking publicity through violence. When he learns that Danielle plans to marry Luke Fenris, the multimillionaire who symbolizes everything Mallum hates about America, he knows what CRUSH’s next mission will be. Then he learns what Fenris is really up to. Luke Fenris, a reclusive right-wing multi-millionaire who hates the Welfare State. Despite intensive journalistic investigation, his past remains a deep mystery. Although few know much about him, he has captured the public imagination as a can-do leader who many want to see run for President. He believes a left-wing media conspiracy wants to destroy individual freedom and turn America into a socialist state. Despite disappearing for weeks at a time, only to reappear for just a couple of days each month, he has brought together several influential co-conspirators to change the way America works. And that’s only the first stage of his plan. Ludwig Von Dracula, head of the Vampire Liberation Front and award-winning advertising copywriter, who has befriended Mallum. Dracula claims to be a descendant of his infamous namesake and tells Mallum the dangerous secret behind that strange night at the Pentagram Pub. He also tells Mallum that there is only one way to stop Fenris, but Mallum doesn’t like what he hears.

 Prose	 Prose, and Plays (Library of America)","Justly celebrated at home and abroad, Robert Frost is perhaps America’s greatest twentieth-century poet and a towering figure in American letters. From the publication of his first collections, A Boy’s Will (1913) and North of Boston (1914), Frost was recognized as a poet of unique power and formal skill, and the enduring significance of his work has been acknowledged by each subsequent generation. His poetry ranges from deceptively simply pastoral lyrics and genial, vernacular genre pieces to darker meditations, complex and ironic. Here, based on extensive research into his manuscripts and published work, is the first authoritative and truly comprehensive collection of his writings. Brought together for the first time in a Library of America single volume is all the major poetry, a generous selection of uncollected poems, all of Frost’s dramatic writing, and the most extensive gathering of his prose writings ever published, several of which are printed here for the first time. The core of this collection is the 1949 Complete Poems of Robert Frost, the last collection supervised by Frost himself. This version of the poems is free of unauthorized editorial changes introduced into subsequent editions. Also included is In the Clearing (1962), Frost’s final volume of poetry. Verse drawn from letters, articles, pamphlets, and journals makes up the largest selection of uncollected poems ever assembled, including nearly two dozen beautiful early works printed for the first time. Also gathered here are all the dramatic works: three plays and two verse masques. The unprecedented prose section includes more than three times as many items as any other collection available. It is rich and diverse, presenting many newly discovered or rediscovered pieces. Especially unusual items include Frost’s contribution to John F. Kennedy’s inauguration and two fascinating 1959 essays on “The Future of Man.” Several manuscript items are published here for the first time, including the essays “‘Caveat Poeta’” and “The Way There,” Frost’s remarks on being appointed poetry consultant to the Library of Congress in 1958, the preface to a proposed new edition of North of Boston, and many others. A selection of letters represents all of Frost’s important comments about prosody, poetics, style, and his theory of “sentence sounds.” LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.",['Robert Frost'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pahNEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pahNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Robert+Frost:+Collected+Poems,+Prose,+and+Plays+(Library+of+America)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Library of America,1995-10-01,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pahNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Robert+Frost:+Collected+Poems,+Prose,+and+Plays+(Library+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Poetry'],	R

"‘A wonderfully beautiful legend tells us that when Lucifer fell from heaven to earth a precious stone fell from his crown… This precious stone is in a certain respect nothing else than the full power of the “I”.’ Seven years after staging Edward Schuré’s drama The Children of Lucifer	"‘A wonderfully beautiful legend tells us that when Lucifer fell from heaven to earth a precious stone fell from his crown… This precious stone is in a certain respect nothing else than the full power of the “I”.’ Seven years after staging Edward Schuré’s drama The Children of Lucifer, Rudolf Steiner felt able to talk openly about the complex relationship between the beings of Lucifer and Christ. In an extraordinary series of lectures, Steiner addresses the difficult and often misunderstood subject of Lucifer’s role in human development. Speaking within the broader context of ancient and modern – Eastern and Western – spiritual teachings, Steiner clarifies that Lucifer is not the simple caricature of evil that many imagine, but rather plays a pivotal role in human development. Whilst Rudolf Steiner held a deep respect for Eastern philosophy, he worked consistently from his personal knowledge of the Western – Christian – esoteric tradition. At a time when many of his colleagues revered ancient Eastern texts, Steiner viewed these same documents as representations of an earlier stage of human consciousness; as evidence of the heights that Eastern wisdom had reached, thousands of years before the development of Western science and culture. But Steiner maintains that the ancient truths need to be understood in the context of contemporary knowledge: that the old wisdom of the East has to be seen in the light of the West. Chapters include: Eternity and Time – Comparison of the Wisdom of East and West – The Nature of the Physical and the Astral Worlds – Evolutionary Stages – The Children of Lucifer and the Brothers of Christ – Lucifer and Christ – The Nature of the Luciferic Influence in History – The Bodhisattvas and the Christ.",['Rudolf Steiner'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nec4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=nec4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+east+in+the+light+of+the+west:+The+children+of+Lucifer+and+the+brothers+of+Christ&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Rudolf Steiner Press,2017-10-23,http://books.google.nl/books?id=nec4DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+east+in+the+light+of+the+west:+The+children+of+Lucifer+and+the+brothers+of+Christ&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Anthroposophy'],	R

"No recent scientific enterprise has been so alluring	"No recent scientific enterprise has been so alluring, terrifying, and filled with extravagant promise and frustrating setbacks as artificial intelligence. How intelligent are the best of today's AI programs? To what extent can we entrust them with decisions that affect our lives? How human-like do we expect them to become, and how soon do we need to worry about them surpassing us in most, if not all, human endeavours? From leading AI researcher and award-winning author Melanie Mitchell comes a knowledgeable and captivating account of modern-day artificial intelligence. Flavoured with personal stories and a twist of humor, Artificial Intelligence illuminates the workings of machines that mimic human learning, perception, language, creativity and common sense. Weaving together advances in AI with cognitive science and philosophy, Mitchell probes the extent to which today's 'smart' machines can actually think or understand, and whether AI requires such elusive human qualities in order to be reliable, trustworthy and beneficial.

The stark immediacy of what happened in 1692 has obscured the complex web of human passion which climaxed in the Salem witch trials From rich and varied sources—many neglected and unknown—Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum give us a picture of the people and events more intricate and more fascinating than any other in the massive literature. It is a story of powerful and deeply divided families and of a community determined to establish an independent identity—beset by restraints and opposition from without and factional conflicts from within—and a minister whose obsessions helped to bring this volatile mix to the flash point. Not simply a dramatic and isolated event, the Salem outbreak has wider implications for our understanding of developments central to the American experience: the disintegration of Puritanism, the pressures of land and population in New England towns, the problems besetting farmer and householder, the shifting role of the church, and the powerful impact of commercial capitalism.",['Paul Boyer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FIRtMQabjJ4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FIRtMQabjJ4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Salem+Possessed,+The+Social+Origins+of+Witchcraft&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Harvard University Press,1976-01-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FIRtMQabjJ4C&source=gbs_api,['History'],4.0	R

"The red and black Concord stagecoaches that crossed the West in the 1860s	"The red and black Concord stagecoaches that crossed the West in the 1860s, known to the Indians as ""fire boxes,"" have been celebrated in Mark Twain's fiction and JohnøFord's films. Predating the transcontinental railroads, they provided vital lines of communication to the East during the Civil War and opened to development the newly settled regions beyond the Missouri River. From 1862 to 1866 Ben Holladay owned and operated a network of stagecoach lines from Kansas to California, the main one following the central mail route between Atchison and Salt Lake City established by the U.S. government in 1848, and other lines branching into the mining country of California and Montana and Idaho territories. In spite of bad weather, primitive roads, holdups by highwaymen, and trouble with Indians, Holladay's coaches delivered passengers and mail on schedule. J. V. Frederick describes in fascinating detail the organization and operation of a vast transportation empire ruled by a man with executive genius and a gambler's instincts. Although Holladay forbade drinking and profanity on the job, he commanded the loyalty of his drivers, whom he dressed in broad-brimmed sombreros, corduroys trimmed with velvet, and high-heeled boots. He sold out just before the Union Pacific Railroad was completed and until his death in 1887 remained popular with Americans, who named racehorses and cigars after him.",['J. V.

"A New York Times bestseller	"A New York Times bestseller, this controversial guide to improving your marriage has transformed thousands of relationships, bringing women romance, harmony, and the intimacy they crave. Like millions of women, Laura Doyle wanted her marriage to be better.

Desperate to be in love with her man again, she decided to stop telling him what to do and how to do it. When Doyle surrendered control, something magical happened. The union she had always dreamed of appeared. The man who had wooed her was back.

Compassionate and practical, The Surrendered Wife is a step-by-step guide that teaches women how to: · Give up unnecessary control and responsibility · Resist the temptation to criticize, belittle, or dismiss their husbands · Trust their husbands in every aspect of marriage—from sexual to financial · And more.

"A paradigm-shifting blend of science	"A paradigm-shifting blend of science, religion, and philosophy for agnostic, spiritual-but-not-religious, and scientifically minded readers Many people are fed up with the way traditional religion alienates them: too easily it can perpetuate conflict, vilify science, and undermine reason. Nancy Abrams, a philosopher of science, lawyer, and lifelong atheist, is among them. And yet, when she turned to the recovery community to face a personal struggle, she found that imagining a higher power gave her a new freedom. Intellectually, this was quite surprising. Meanwhile her husband, famed astrophysicist Joel Primack, was helping create a new theory of the universe based on dark matter and dark energy, and Abrams was collaborating with him on two books that put the new scientific picture into a social and political context. She wondered, “Could anything actually exist in this strange new universe that is worthy of the name ‘God?’” In A God That Could Be Real, Abrams explores a radically new way of thinking about God. She dismantles several common assumptions about God and shows why an omniscient, omnipotent God that created the universe and plans what happens is incompatible with science—but that this doesn’t preclude a God that can comfort and empower us. Moving away from traditional arguments for God, Abrams finds something worthy of the name “God” in the new science of emergence: just as a complex ant hill emerges from the collective behavior of individually clueless ants, and just as the global economy emerges from the interactions of billions of individuals’ choices, God, she argues, is an “emergent phenomenon” that arises from the staggering complexity of humanity’s collective aspirations and is in dialogue with every individual. This God did not create the universe—it created the meaning of the universe. It’s not universal—it’s planetary. It can’t change the world, but it helps us change the world. A God that could be real, Abrams shows us, is what humanity needs to inspire us to collectively cooperate to protect our warming planet and create a long-term civilization.",['Nancy Ellen Abrams'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cQVoBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cQVoBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Science+of+the+Gods&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Beacon Press,2015-03-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cQVoBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],13.0	R

 1950-2000"	 1950-2000","During the so-called ""Age of Melancholy,"" many writers invoked both traditional and new conceptualizations of the disease in order to account for various types of social turbulence, ranging from discontent and factionalism to civil war. Writing about melancholy became a way to explore both the causes and preventions of political disorder, on both specific and abstract levels. Thus, at one and the same moment, a writer could write about melancholy to discuss specific and ongoing political crises and to explore more generally the principles which generate political conflicts in the first place. In the course of developing a traditional discourse of melancholy of its own, English writers appropriated representations of the disease - often ineffectively - in order to account for the political turbulence during the civil war and Interregnum periods.","['David Jenness', 'Don Velsey']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vz1kQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Vz1kQgAACAAJ&dq=Classic+American+Popular+Song:+The+Second+Half-Century,+1950-2000&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",,2006,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Vz1kQgAACAAJ&dq=Classic+American+Popular+Song:+The+Second+Half-Century,+1950-2000&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Music'],	R

The great winged Lion stares over a Venice where magic thrives. The rich Venetian Republic is a bastion of independence and tolerance. Perhaps for that reason, it is also corrupt, and rotten with intrigue. But for the young brothers Marco and Benito Valdosta, vagabond and thief, Venice is simply-home. They have no idea that they stand at the center of the city's coming struggle for its very life. They know nothing of the powerful forces moving in the background. They have barely heard of Chernobog, demonlord of the North, who is shifting his pawns to attack Venice in order to cut into the underbelly of the Holy Roman Empire. All Marco and Benito know is that they're hungry and in dangerous company: Katerina the smuggler, Caesare the sell-sword, Montagnard assassins, church inquisitors, militant Knights of the Holy Trinity, Dottore Marina the Strega mage . . . and Maria. Maria might be an honest canaler, but she had the hottest temper a boy could find. Yet among the dark waters of the canals lurk far worse dangers than a hot-tempered girl. Chernobog has set a monster loose to wreak havoc on the city. Magic, murder and evil are all at work to pull Venice down. Fanatical monks seek to root out true witchcraft with fire and sword. Steel-clad Teutonic knights, wealth traders, church dignitaries and great Princes fight and plot for control of the jewel of the Mediterranean. And somehow all of these, from thieves to mages to princes, must gather around Marco and his brother Benito, under the shadow of the great winged lion of Venice.

"The beat is universal -- drumming as a way of communicating with other people	"The beat is universal -- drumming as a way of communicating with other people, spirits, and self exists around the world and throughout time. And contemporary drumming is thriving! In the neo-pagan community, the most popular festivals and workshops are those that feature drumming circles. In healing centers, nursing homes, women's centers, and schools across the country, people are forming drumming circles. Sacred Beat honors and explores every aspect of drumming -- historical, contemporary, practical. In Part I, Telesco and Waterhawk tell the history of drums and drumming circles and the myths, superstitions, and religions that have grown up around drumming. From West Africa to Tibet, from Siberia to England, from Vietnam to Apache territory, where Fox gave the people drums along with fire -- come stories about drums, their invention, their use up until contemporary times. People respond almost universally and profoundly to drums -- to relieve stress, to communicate, to move in rhythm with the universe, to praise their gods. A comprehensive section of practical information follows, with ideas for finding a drum and other rhythmic tools that are right for your vision, caring for and decorating your instrument, drum etiquette, and elements of a good drum circle. The next section of Sacred Beat is all about drumming in groups -- different ways it's being done, from Native American Pow-Wows to Goddess gatherings to community centers, and how to become a part of it. The book closes with a section on creating drumming magic all your own, with meditations, prayers, and divinations to create overall well-being and spiritual awareness with drums. The voice of the drum combines with the voice of the Ancestors, the voice of Spirit, and the voice of our own soul to create a powerful and transformational partnership. By working with the drum, a person can support this partnership, reach out to the community, touch the earth, and nurture their own spirit.","['Patricia Telesco', 'Don Waterhawk']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gy0h6TvCpU4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gy0h6TvCpU4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sacred+Beat:+From+the+Heart+of+the+Drum+Circle&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Red Wheel,2003-06-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gy0h6TvCpU4C&source=gbs_api,['Music'],	R
"In 1856	"In 1856, the English photographer Francis Frith set out on the first of three tours of Egypt and the Holy Lands. Traveling up the Nile and then on to the Sinai, Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon, Frith systematically crafted exquisite pictures of ruins, landscapes, and legendary sites. He then published his views in England and America in a variety of formats, becoming something of a celebrity in photographic circles. This book, the first to place Frith's Egyptian and Levantine images in cultural context, reveals the distinct meanings these ostensibly ""topographic"" pictures held for the photographer and his Victorian audience. A Quaker by birth and an entrepreneur by nature, Frith brought to his photographic projects a sense of mission: to revive and confirm the stories of the Bible, while offering the region to armchair travelers as a seamless Oriental milieu of Romantic reverie. Francis Frith in Egypt and Palestine narrates the political, intellectual, and social concerns that make Frith representative of England's encounter with the East in the nineteenth century. Historian of photography Douglas R. Nickel brings a sophisticated interdisciplinary approach to bear on the subject in order to expose the complexity of Frith's image-making, setting the photographs against a Victorian backdrop of religious debate, imperialist thought, Romantic philosophy, and Pre-Raphaelite aesthetics.","['Douglas Robert Nickel', 'Francis Frith']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XudqQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XudqQgAACAAJ&dq=Francis+Frith+in+Egypt+and+Palestine:+A+Victorian+Photographer+Abroad&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2004-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XudqQgAACAAJ&dq=Francis+Frith+in+Egypt+and+Palestine:+A+Victorian+Photographer+Abroad&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Photography'],	R

Discovered as a child-prodigy pianist in his native Poland, he later travelled to France, where he remained after the Polish uprising of 1830-31. There he gave few public performances, but worked as composer and piano teacher. He later became a French citizen and conducted a stormy relationship with French writer George Sand (Aurore Dudevant). He died at 39 of pulmonary tuberculosis. Chopin innovated many traditional forms of piano music and also created new forms such as the ballade.

"THESE 24 Iroquois legends and stories have been told in the homes of the Iroquois for many centuries; long before the white man arrived on the North American continent. The perusal and study of these stories will	"THESE 24 Iroquois legends and stories have been told in the homes of the Iroquois for many centuries; long before the white man arrived on the North American continent. The perusal and study of these stories will, it is believed, give as much pleasure to the reader, as they have given the compiler. Of special interest is the “Legend of Hiawatha” made famous fifty years earlier by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Some of the stories and lengends in this volume are: The Birth of the Arbutus A Legend Of The River Legends Of The Corn The First Winter The Great Mosquito The Story Of Oniata The Legends of Hiawatha, and many, many more. The American Indians, like so many cultures, built neither monuments nor wrote books. However, they did make picture writings, known in later years as “wampum.” Mostly, these were mere symbols, recording mainly feats of arms. However, the Iroquois used wampum as a record of a person’s credentials or a certificate of authority. It was also used for official purposes and religious ceremonies, and it was used as a way to bind peace between tribes. Among the Iroquois, every chief and every clan mother has a certain string of wampum that serves as their certificate of office. When they pass on or are removed from their station, the string will then pass on to the new leader. Runners carrying messages during colonial times would present the wampum showing that they had the authority to carry the message. Wampum is still used to this day by the Iroquois in the ceremony of raising up a new chief and in the Iroquois Thanksgiving ceremonies. If the American forefathers had taken more interest in the peoples they found on the Western Continent, spending less of their energies in devising plans for cheating the Indians out of their furs and lands—a policy their descendants have closely followed and admirably succeeded in—our libraries might contain volumes of fairy tales that would delight the youth of many generations. =========== KEYWORDS/TAGS: Legends of the Iroquois, Aliquipiso, American Indian, american indian ancestry, American Indian books, American Indian childrens books, american indian east coast, american indian Iroquois, american Indian legends, american indian songs, american indian stories, american indian tales, american indian traditions, american indian tribes, american indian values, american indian warriors, american indian words, animals, Arbutus, arrows, Ash Tree, assemble, Authority, beads, bear, beautiful, beaver, bedtime stories, birds, Birth, brave, Buzzard's Covering, canoe, chief, children, childrens books, childrens stories, Confederation, corn, Cornplanter, council, council fire, dead, death, death song, eagle, earth spirits, evil, fables, fairy tales, First Winter, Flying Head, folklore, Folk-Lore, forest, fox, Gift, Great, Great Mosquito, happiness, Happy, Healing Waters, heart, Hiawatha, horse, Hunter, Hunting Grounds, Indians, Iroquois, Kanistagia, lakes, Legend of the River, legends, Legends of the Corn, lodge, lover, maiden, Manito, medicine, men, Message Bearers, Mirror in the Water, Mohawk, mountains, myths, Native American, Nekumonta, Oneida, Oniata, Onondagas, Origin, Orontadeka, panther, papoose, peace, Peacemaker, pipe, raccoon, river, sachem, sacred, Sacred Stone, Sacrifice, Seneca, Shanewis, Spirit, stories, streams, summer, sun, Tiogaughwa, trail, trees, Turtle Clan, Unwelcome Visitor, village, Violet, wampum, warriors, waters, white men, Why Animals do not Talk, wigwam, wild, wisdom, Wise Sachem, wolf, woods, young people",['Anon E.

Drawing on the biblical chronicle of David’s life as well as on the later commentaries and the Psalms—traditionally considered to be David’s own words—Pinsky teases apart the many strands of David’s story and reweaves them into a glorious narrative.

Rel plays Dr. Seuss the ultimate compliment of treating him as a serious poet as well as one of the 20th century's most interesting visual artists, and after reading his book I decided that a trip to the Mandeville Collections of the library at University of California in San Diego was in order, so I could visit some of the incredible Seuss/Geisel holdings they have there.There's almost too much to take in, for, like William Butler Yeats, Seuss led a career that constantly shifted and metamoprhized itself to meet new historical and political cirsumstances, so he seems to have been both a leftist and a conservative at different junctures of his career, both in politics and in art. As Nel shows us, he was once a cartoonist for the fabled PM magazine and, like Andy Warhol, he served his time slaving in the ad business too. All was in the service of amusing and broadening the minds of US children. Nel doesn't hesitate to administer a sound spanking to the Seuss industry that, since his death, has seen fit to license all kinds of awful products including the recent CAT IN THE HAT film with Mike Myers. Oh, what a cat-astrophe!The book is great and I can especially recommend the work of the picture editor who has given us a bounty of good illustrations."	R

For me, a daddy to a large family who learned to read with Dr. Seuss and who has memorized too many of the books via repeated readings to young children, Prof. Nel's brilliant 'American Icon' is a long awaited treat. At last a serious treatment of this remarkable genius that is both an engaging read and filled with remarkable insights! I especially enjoyed (and learned more than I care to admit from) Prof. Nel's discussions of the Disneyfication of Seuss - which Nel links to failings in American copyright law, ""the other sides of Dr. Seuss"" - all of which sides were new to me, and the political genesis of his secular morality in the WWII cartoon work he did at PM magazine. The chapters on Geisel's poetry and artwork and the link Nel makes between Seuss and the historical avant guarde alone make this book a ""must buy"" for parents and serious readers, not to mention public libraries. Readers of Nel's other books will find the same engaging writing style that makes the book a fun read while imparting a mountain of information and important ideas. This is simply the best and most comprehensive book yet written on the work of Seuss Geisel and what will certainly be the standard for many years to come. Thank you, Prof. Nel, wherever you are, from a reader who grew up with the good doctor and who is growing up with him again years later. Your book, written from your encyclopeadic knowledge of children's literature and the media of this genre - from scanning verse to cubist painting! - explains the power, limits, and popularity of the Seuss phenomenon."

Dr. Seuss: American Icon	Dr. Seuss: American Icon,,A2MVUWT453QH61,"Roy E. Perry ""amateur philosopher""",7/7,4.0,1090713600,Phlip Nel gives silly Seuss a serious treatment,"Theodore Seuss Geisel (1904-1991), aka &quot;Dr. Seuss,&quot; was one of the most influential writers and artists of the 20th century.In 1959, Rudolf Flesch wrote, &quot;A hundred years from now, children and their parents will still eagerly read the books of a fellow called Ted Geisel, popularly known as Dr. Seuss.&quot;Flesch was too conservative in his prediction. A century, and more, from today, Dr. Seuss will still be read when many authors on today's bestseller lists will be forgotten.Published on the centenary of Geisel's birth, Dr. Seuss: American Icon analyzes six key aspects of Seuss's career: poetry, politics, art, biography, marketing, and influence.In six insightful chapters, Philip Nel, Assistant Professor of English at Kansas State University, discusses &quot;U.S. Laureate of Nonsense,&quot; &quot;Dr. Seuss vs. Adolf Hitler,&quot; &quot;The Doc in the Smock,&quot; &quot;The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. S.,&quot; &quot;The Disneyfication of Dr. Seuss,&quot; and &quot;The Cat in the Hat for President.&quot;Nel gives short shrift to Geisel's childhood and family background--and, indeed, to biography in general--preferring to focus on Seuss's writing and art, from his first book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (1937) to his last book, Oh, the Places You'll Go! (1990).Dr. Seuss's breakthrough year was 1957, when he published the two books with which he is most often identified: The Cat in the Hat and How the Grinch Stole Christmas!Other classic works in the Seussian canon are: Horton Hears a Who! (&quot;A person's a person, no matter how small&quot;), Yertle the Turtle (modeled on the rise of Adolf Hitler), Green Eggs and Ham (Seuss's bestselling book), The Sneeches (a criticism of anti-Semitism), The Lorax (a protest against corporate abuse of the environment), and The Butter Battle Book (a critique of Reagan's enthusiasm for the nuclear arms trace).His favorite work, among the books he authored, was The Cat in the Hat, for it, more than any other, taught children to read.While many of his books have a clear and powerful moral, Seuss had a horror of heavy-handed preaching. He sought to teach and ignite the imagination, but was a lifelong opponent of smug, self-righteous bourgeois moralism.&quot;Seuss was a contrarian,&quot; writes Nel, &quot;who enjoyed challenging people to reconsider their assumptions. [He had a] rebellious imagination and a dispositional distaste for rules and regulations.&quot; His work was a &quot;rational insanity&quot; that exhibited &quot;joyous anarchy&quot; and a &quot;lifelong thrill in misbehaving.&quot;A better subtitle for Nel's work would have been American Icon and Iconoclast.Nel tells of Seuss's early years as an advertising artist and as a agitprop cartoonist. The book, however, is not a biography; it is a serious study in the genres of literary and art criticism.For readers who want more biographical information, Nel recommends Dr. Seuss and Mr. Geisel, by Judith Morgan and Neil Morgan (1995), which he describes as &quot;the definitive biography and the single best secondary source on Seuss. Any discussion of Seuss's life and work must begin with this book.&quot;Dr. Seuss: American Icon includes 103 pages of notes, index, and the most comprehensive annotated Seuss bibliography ever assembled. One learns a lot from this book; the author's lucid style makes it not only an enlightening work but a fun read.Philip Nel is the author of J. K.

Richards ""ninthwavestore""",3/3,4.0,1107993600,Good academic overview,"Philip Nel - Dr. Seuss: American IconThis is basically an academic overview of Seuss poetry, art, cartoons, and the problems with the commercialization of the Seuss name and works after his death. It is not, to any real extent, a biography. Those seeking such should move on.As an academic book it leans on the dry side. It assumes the reader has a fairly good knowledge of Children's Literature and 20th Century cartoons (not the animated kind). Not a book to begin your Dr. Seuss experience with. But if you have read them to your children and are interested about the writing style (there is a good chapter about his poetry) or his art style (not as good a chapter, but still interesting).What interested me the most was the deconstruction of the recent rush to ""cash in"" on Seuss by Hollywood and advertisers. I think that Nel wants to come down against it, but based on Seuss' background (he started out drawing Flit ads) and the projects he approved during his lifetime; it is a tough argument to make. In the end though Nel does point out that maybe the movies and tie- ins did not have to be so... crass?The book is well researched; lots of neat tidbits are to be gleamed. Early cartoons by Seuss for PM magazine were occasionally (by today's standards) shockingly racist. It makes him a little more human and puts his latter works like the Lorax in a new light.Those in Education may enjoy this background. Fans of Seuss will enjoy the exhaustive bibliography of Seuss's many, many works. Also good list of other works about the man."	R

In this thoughtful book, Mr. Nel deepens our appreciation for Seuss as a distinctively American poet, artist and educator. The author demonstrates Seuss' wide ranging influence and argues for his rightful place among the most important cultural figures of the 20th century.An English professor at Kansas State University, Mr. Nel uses his historic knowledge to discuss how Seuss' text belongs to a tradition of great nonsense writers. Mr. Nel states that Seuss' carefully-constructed absurdist tales encourage children to challenge the status quo by gently skewering the grown-up world; elsewhere, he uses charts to show how Seuss effectively used meter and rhyme to complement his intentionally ridiculous plots and create masterful stories that have stood up well to the test of time.Mr. Nel recounts Seuss' early career as advertising illustrator and political cartoonist to help us better understand the influences that shaped his classic children's work. As an artist, Mr. Nel suggests that the term ""energetic cartoon surrealism"" appropriately describes Seuss' creative synthesis of cubism, art nouveau, surrealism and other styles. While Seuss' influence can be detected in modern rap music, children's books, political cartoons and more, Mr. Nel contends that Seuss would not have been happy about the manner in which his works have been posthumously marketed, opining that the ""Disneyification"" or simplification of Seuss' stories for marketable purposes ""threatens to make 'Seuss' synomynous with the ambiguous power of global capitalism"". Such commercialism would appear to collide with Seuss' desire to develop critical thinking among young people and to help us all imagine a better world.I highly recommend this book for everyone interested in gaining greater insight and perspective into one of America's greatest creative talents."

In fact, he's writes so far from it, with a smart and precise style, I am tempted to revise how I feel about professor-writers. However, in accordance with his academia roots, Nel has a 100 page annotated bibliogarphy that goes along with his work, a nice shrine to prove his homework was well done.As far the actual book goes it is an excellent piece work. ""Dr. Seuss: American Icon"" looks at the man behind Dr. Suess not as a straight-forward biography, but rather it focuses on different areas of Dr. Suess (i.e. poet, poetry of, artist, artistic style, adult, activist, etc.) and interjects those discussions with biogrphical anecdotes.

If the word 'study' makes you nervous, rest assured: this is not a jargon-filled, pretentious analysis. It is, instead, a nicely written work that views Seuss from several different angles: as a poet, a visual artist, a cartoonist, and so on. Nel writes intelligently on how Seuss fits into the canon of nonsense poets, and provides good background on the roots of Seuss's visual style. Some of the WW2/political cartoon material I had read about before, but Nel covers it thoroughly. The most fascinating chapter to me deals with the marketing of Seuss, particularly since his death. Nel holds forth strongly on the abominable 'Grinch' movie (and I trust he feels the same way about the 'Cat in the Hat' film too), and gets into a very interesting discussion of the possible motivations behind the ever-expanding empire of Dr. Seuss Enterprises. (And no, I don't believe it is purely about the profits!)Two small quibbles prevent me from awarding five stars. Firstly, I would have liked the book to be a little longer. The in-depth bibliography is interesting in itself and will be a goldmine to future researchers, but I'm sure Nel could have found a few more things to say - perhaps about Seuss's gender politics.

I may have to reorder the &quot;Big Small Church Book&quot; as my copy is nearly worn out. If I had only two choices for resources for pastors of small churches, it would be these two.I hope the author considers focusing on Christian Education in another book. There is a section in the &quot;Big Small Church Book&quot; on Christian Education, but concentrating on one of the most important church functions individually makes a huge difference, as is proven by this new book. I tell all my colleagues that Rev. Ray's books are worth every dollar and more."	R

Lajoy ""Cindy La Joy""",1/1,5.0,1248307200,Not Just for Pastors!,"I just finished reading this amazing book and came away with an entirely different perspective on our smaller congregation. As a ministry leader it is easy to become depressed over what can not be accomplished, and how overworked everyone is in a small church...but we often fail to see all that IS being accomplished and how extraordinary our smaller congregations are.There are many pluses outlined in this book about what works about being smaller, and in this day of mega churches the reminder is a good one. There are some very good tips about altering worship for smaller congregations and valuing it's unique size and working with it well.For the thousands of us who find ourselves in churches with membership of 100 or less, for those who are discouraged when worship attendence is 30 or 40 during the summer, this book is such an uplifting perspective you can't help but be energized!Unlike many tomes of this nature, this is an easy read and the layperson can gobble it up and immediately put it to use. David Ray's writing style is accessible and doesn't make assumptions about the knowledge of the reader, offering explanations where needed that were very helpful.Pick it up even if you are not a pastor, you will gain something from it, I guarantee it!"

This is the book on worship,"I hadn't been a small church pastor very long before I began to hear about David R. Ray. If you do any reading in this area, you'll start to see other authors refer to him and a handful of others, especially Anthony Pappas and Carl Dudley (who are also excellent). But Ray is different. Reading his work, I felt as if he had actually visited MY home church. He describes some of the personalities in a church family, and I could supply their names. He lists some of the ""Thou Shalts"" of a strong worship service, and I heard echoes of my most recent deacons' meeting. He not only gets small church culture, he celebrates it, and he is eager to help small churches learn to get and to celebrate themselves. If you are part of a church where low-morale often coexists with feisty pride, this is a resource that will help. It offers some ways of identifying what church families with 50 or fewer need and hope for from their churches, and how to offer it in ways that are inclusive, warm, fun and authentic. Hallelujah!"	R

Unfortunately, I was deeply disappointed by page three. I always buy books in the hope and expectation of having an enjoyable read, not to criticise. However, this book is in urgent need of good editing -- though quite possibly editing alone wouldn't save it. Examples: a bed squeaks slightly and sharply in the same sentence; a nightgown hangs freely over her girlish figure and olive colored complexion; coffee aromas huddle; rumbling clouds huddle (as well as the coffee?); she prepared to sip her coffee beneath the wrath of God... cuddled within the arms of a strong breeze; (the wrath of God is a breeze?); the Columbian (stet) coffee aroma danced beneath her sculpted tan nose; the coffee bean fragrance tangoed within her body; she placed her thick pink lips against the warm cup;... and so on, all by page three.

I read this book and after watching the war of the words I couldn't help, but to jump in. I am on the good side of the book. I loved how it kept my intersted. On the bad side I have to say, there was a typo featured on the back cover and the secret to liking this book is making it through the first chapter. I have to admit I was a little curious when I read some of the reviews. They were so mean and false that it spiked my curiosity. I then like the last review noticed that the ""Traveling librarian"" wrote a completely ignorant review on this book. My first thought was wait a minute, that was not the book that I read. I read my copy once again and realized her entire review was fabricated. Then I knew, it was some kind of game. Maybe it is someone who dislikes the author for personal reasons, that has posted more then one awful review, or maybe this is another who is jealous, Who knows?

I howled with laughter all the way through, wondering how much worse it could get - and sure enough, it got worse. If the writing is bad, the plot is ludicrous. A preacher comes to offer condolences the same afternoon that the heroine's husband is shot dead. Within moments they are having sex. The sex is not sensually treated or beautifully described - no, all they do is stick their tongues down each other's throats. The preacher goes to tell his paralysed wife. Her bizarre response - wait for it - is to stick her tongue down his throat. No wonder he veers away. The heroine runs off to work in the heart of Liverpool in a rose garden ten miles long (I kid you not). Did I mention she is dying? But never mind, she'll make a miraculous recovery. She meets another man - even though, conveniently, he's dying too, and she's pregnant by the preacher by now (and, oh joy, she hears the heartbeat of the fetus at a week... truly, a miracle)! The other man lives in castle and is very rich. Of course. They consumate their affair when she sticks her tongue down his throat. Not to worry, she doesn't have to perform this crude tonsil-tickling for long. The preacher turns up again. Everyone in the way drops dead, leaving the coast free for the ""wicked saints"" of the title to romp without blame or shame into the sunset.I could have kicked myself for buying this book; but I had been fooled by reading a mention of it by a so-called reviewer of The Mermaid Chair (which is a good book.) Then I checked all the other reviews done by reviewers of Ms Haddon's book (you can click on ""other reviews"" to see what I mean) and believe I have spotted a scam. The reviewers appear to have chosen the same half dozen best sellers to review -- each on the same day! - and in each review of these other genuinely good books they mention Wicked Saints in the most glowing terms. This is cynical piggy-back riding on bona fide books, made worse because this is a very badly edited (and badly written) self published book.

The book's three sections move from a focus on spirituality and healing, to theology in social and political context, and on to questions of identity and diaspora.The book begins with the voices of female practitioners and then offers a broad, interdisciplinary examination of Caribbean religion and culture. Afro-Caribbean religions, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity are all addressed, with specific reflections on Santer&iacute;a, Palo Monte, Vodou, Winti, Obeah, Kali Mai, Orisha work, Spiritual Baptist faith, Spiritualism, Rastafari, Confucianism, Congregationalism, Pentecostalism, Catholicism, and liberation theology. Some essays are based on fieldwork, archival research, and textual or linguistic analysis, while others are concerned with methodological or theoretical issues.

The Church of Christ: A Biblical Ecclesiology for Today	The Church of Christ: A Biblical Ecclesiology for Today,25.97,ARI272XF8TOL4,Christopher J. Bray,74/81,5.0,955411200,Ecclesiological Milestone,"With the publication of Everett Ferguson's book on ecclesiology, another milestone has been reached in the scholarly presentation of the distinctive theological perspective of Churches of Christ. The book is divided into six chapters, each roughly sixty to seventy pages in length. Within each chapter, Ferguson neatly and systematically outlines his thoughts and arguments. The first chapter, entitled ""The People and the Messiah: History and Eschatology,"" deals mainly with background issues. It examines the Old Testament teaching on the importance of covenant and the meaning of the phrase ""kingdom of God"" in its relationship to an and distinction from the church. Ferguson enters into the New Testament and ecclesiology proper via a consideration of Jesus as Messiah, including a careful exegesis of Matt. 16:13-23, where he concludes that the ""rock"" of Matt. 16:18 is not Peter, but the fact of Jesus' Messiahship. Ferguson's analysis of Matt. 16:13-23 is insightful and carefully articulated. Within this section, he gives attention to ""the gates of Hades will not prevail"" and concludes with some interesting yet encouraging insight. In the second chapter, ""The Church and Her Lord: The Nature of the Church,"" Ferguson deals with and focuses on three images, ""people of God,"" ""body of Christ,"" and ""community of the Spirit."" A peculiar feature in this chapter is placing the discussion of the word ekklesia last rather than first. The latter would seem more appropriate and would seem to set the stage for the chapter, especially for a work of biblical ecclesiology. This great section will open the eyes of the reader and renew his focus of church. That is to say, this chapter correctly puts Christ as the head of the church and gives Him His appropriate place. The third chapter concentrates on, ""The Church and Her Savior: Salvation and Church Membership."" Essentially this section covers soteriology, which determines ecclesiology, but it is not ecclesiology itself. His full treatment of the nature of sin, the meaning of the cross, and the human response to God's saving work is only loosely linked to his topic of ecclesiology. This is not to say that this section is uninteresting or uninformative because it is quite helpful for a fuller understanding of these matters. Far more important is the content of Ferguson's soteriology. Ferguson is strong when it comes to the necessity of baptism. A few statements will give the reader an idea of his position: ""Baptism is the time at which one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God"" (pg. 170); ""Baptism is a `calling on the name' of the Lord"" (pg. 180); and, ""Baptism is the appointed time at which God pronounces forgiveness"" (pg. 183). He concludes: There must be an objective necessity about baptism, or New Testament writers could not speak of baptism in the way they do"" (pg. 185). How refreshing! In our world of relativity and ecumenism, people need to hear Ferguson's words, especially those in Churches of Christ. The last three chapters move into a more familiar territory for a treatise on the church. Chapter four, ""The Church and Her High Priest: Worship and Assembly"" is a great section for anyone interested in the dynamics of worship. Here, Ferguson begins with a type of etymology as a way of introduction, concentrating on both the Greek and English words. This introduction to the subject sets the stage for the entire chapter. Worship is a hot topic today, thus chapter four is rather applicable for our day with all the differing views. This section is multitudinously faceted and exhaustive. ""The Church and Her Bishop: The Continuing Ministry"" is appropriately the title for the fifth chapter. In this section, Ferguson again touches on some hot topics in the church. It is unfortunate however that he only briefly deals with the debates on miraculous gifts and women's roles. Ferguson advocates a cessasionist position on miraculous gifts and a complementarian position on women's roles, but leaves the reader thirsting for more information and a more comprehensive treatment of the issues. In a day where these two in particular issues are so widely discussed and debated, one would think that they might have received a little concentration. Again, this is not to eradicate what was accomplished in this chapter because it was insightful and obliging, especially given the fact that his discussion on deaconesses was amazingly insightful and well balanced. In chapter six Ferguson adequately covers, ""The Church and Her Teacher: The New Way of Life."" In this section, he includes an unusually prominent consideration of ethics and a very healthy discussion of the importance of Christian fellowship and its concomitant, church discipline. One last thing that must be mentioned about this chapter is Ferguson's section on unity. Although this section is brief, it is significant and insightful. Ferguson lays out the various aspects of unity and does so in just a few short pages. It serves as an excellent conclusion to a monumental work. Of course, any reader is free to take issue with some of Ferguson's conclusions. For example, the distinction that is made between the temporary and permanent endowments of the Spirit still awaits additional clarification, and there will be those who will score Ferguson, despite his disclaimer, for his synchronic rather than diachronic approach to the New Testament writings. This is a courageous book. Its Reformed-Restorationist slant that the proper doctrine of the church entails a return to the faith and practice of the apostolic church is unmistakable. There are numerous nuggets of exegesis and important points of emphases that make this book worth reading. It is astounding that Ferguson deals with so many facets of ecclesiology in a one-volume work. Not only that, but he also includes a helpful subject index as well as a number of bibliographies. Just a glance at his copious footnotes and it is clear that this book is well researched and well documented. This book should be one that every minister, church leader, and ministry student is required to read and ponder."	R

In Rising Sons and Daughters, we learn thatJapanese young people are preserving their country's tradition of respect for their elders while also creating their own identity as Japan's &quot;Generation X&quot;. Like our own young people, they are bombarded with some of the excesses of &quot;Western culture&quot; - Clothing fads, rock groups, a culture of shopping, etc. What they seem to be developing, however, is a healthy hybrid of old and new that retains a firm foundation in good values.

I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the &quot;New Young&quot; of Japan seem to be creating an &quot;international&quot; blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!"	R

He went without any idea of how Japan would treat him. So what he writes seems to come to us without much editing by any pre-made belief. No filters are between us and the experiences he had day to day. All the details about school, family life and learning the language comes to us without any forethought.Compared to other books on Japan this is raw, unmolded, information and is full of insight that I doubt even Wardell realized was amazing for such a young writer. I would say that this is a must for anybody planning on going to Japan for ANY reason.Did find some humor in the fact that Wardell felt the need to explain everything, even what a corn dog was, and that when he met other exchange students one complained about how the Japanese, and I quote, Couldn't even speak English good, end of quote.

It offers the opinions of a diverse sample of real Muslim Women with very different attitudes. It will not appeal to those who don't want to listen or who want an anti-islamic feminist political tract. The value of this is that you hear the opinions, educated and not, of the real people involved.Most of the time, the real voices are ignored and what is presented in the name of feminism is non-muslim american female TV personalities yacking endlessly on about the lives and experiences of people they really don't know and don't want to know.What must be understood above all else is that if you wish to change a society or a culture, you must at the very least understand how the people in that culture who disagree with you think. That is what this book does so well. I may not agree at all with the opinion of every woman in the book, but I at least understand how they think after finishing it.What many will never understand is that Islamic Society has changed and is still changing. But it can only change by consensus from within. No amount of cultural imperialism from western countries is going to change anything for the better.There is also more than a little hypocracy. For all the lectures about the veil from American Women, few of them stop to think about why they are themselves forced into certain choices. A veil isn't great, but its a whole lot more confortable than the pantyhose that many Western women must wear effectively as a condition of employment. One wonders at a certain point if its the veil itself they object to or that as constrasted to their money-driven appearance decisons, the veil has a meaning beyond the secular."	R

Unfortunately, I found the opposite to be the case.I've made numerous attempts to get my head around the principles of the Dramatica theory, with the intention of finally being able to put to use the rather pricey Dramatica Pro software I bought years ago. Both the software itself, and the book of theory explaining it (""Dramatica: A New Theory of Story"") are so riddled with specialized (and somewhat proprietary) jargon that I've long counted myself among the number of users for whom the effort to grasp the principles involved outweighed the potential benefits. (And BTW, I'm no newcomer to the basic premises of story structure; I've got an MFA from a respectable film school, and have worked for many years as a film editor.)I'd had high hopes for ""Dramatica For Screenwriters"", figuring it would serve as a practical layman's guide to understanding and using the software. Unfortunately (there's that word again), despite claims in the author's introduction to the contrary, a few pages in the jargon begins coming at the reader hot and heavy, and unlike in ""Dramatica: A New Theory of Story"", which I already found to be too opaque, here much of the jargon is not even explained in a cursory manner. Reader familiarity is assumed, which would seem to defeat the purpose of the book in the first place.

Perhaps the most unique thing about this book is the &quot;15 essential factors&quot;...unfortunately, many of those 15 factors--though essential--are things the average person applying to law school--particularly top law schools--doesn't care about and might cast aside even after reading this book.I do agree with her that many pre-law advisers are ill-prepared to advise pre-law students and don't know nearly as much as they should. However, if the info in this book is the information she provided other pre-law advisers with, then it's nothing that the advisers nor the students couldn't have come up with themselves or elsewhere. I still say Montauk's book is the best on law school admissions out there, regardless of what schools you're interested in. HIS book is the one with all the insider secrets in it. Wright's book is just a very broad overview of the admissions process, in my opinion.The one thing this book totally has in common with Montauk's book that is very disappointing is that they do nothing to help minorities know what the admissons process will truly be like for them or how to handle it. For that, you have to look up books by Evangeline Mitchell. Most books have a tendency to treat everyone the same, as if all the information applies to them the same, and that is deceiving.In conclusion, if you feel pretty well-informed already about admissions or are looking for an extra bit of information that might give you that edge or illuminate your particular situation...this book is not the one for you. Only if you really know very little about law school admissions might this book be worth it...but I'd still say it'd be best to go with Montauk's eye-opening admissions guide."	R

If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation.

The only thing it doesn't do is have a full LSAT prep course, but it does give you examples of the questions, and tells you how you can structure your own preparation program. Buying this book actually saved me money by helping me choose only to the right law schools for me, and by giving me a way to evaluate LSAT courses.(It turns out that a lot of expensive courses are not as good as you might think!) The appendix alone is worth the cost of the book. It has information on all the law schools sorted by the &quot;15 Essential Factors&quot; for picking law schools as they are outlined in the book.

She is on the side of reticence and writes with the pained nostalgia of a Southerner describing aspects of the War Between the States. Guerstein knows that reticence is a lost cause; she asks only whether it should be.Gurstein makes a quiet case for the reintroduction of taste, judgement, and sensibility into our public lives. This is a common theme these days. What is uncommon is that she derives her &quot;argument&quot; (always presented with the greatest of civility) from the distortion of privacy that somehow led from Brandeis's great legal work on privacy to the transformation of social man to private men and women and eventually to the public dissemination of all sorts of private matters. This is innovative and intriguing.Reticence should emerge from the coordinated behavior of civilized persons; it should not be coerced by legislation and litigation. It is thus especially appropriate that Gurstein never hectors or lectures. Instead, she paints such a delightful alternative portrait of life, far from morning talk radio, nightly real tv, and ever-present commercial messages in nearly all media, that she inspires the reader to aspire toward at least some aspects of reticence.I felt that Gurstein did not define reticence early enough and failed to take advantage of the opportunities to add more detail as the book progressed. I assume that the party of reticence acquired useful knowledge over time, such as after its (happily) failed efforts to prosecute the publisher of Joyce's Ulysses. But these reservations are minor.My most serious concern is whether the domestic party of reticence has foreign (and sometimes not-so-foreign) counterparts in governments that have successfully enforced taste through stern rule of law. I would have appreciated a treatment of these cultural (or anti-cultural) forces. Althoug! h very difficult, such an effort would have greatly sharpened my understanding of the tenets of the party of reticence and its role in our society. Gurstein surely knows that the mere existence of such potential counterparts to her domestic party of reticence may chill further inquiry; after all, she records numerous instances in which the party of exposure has dangled straw men for talismanic protection from true debate. It would be very useful if Gurstein, accounting for the human rights of those oppressed by governmental regimes, could make a better case for the human rights of those increasingly oppressed by the party of exposure, whose methodology of oppression is vastly different. The incremental personal losses to the party of exposure do not lend themselves to the same degree of drama, but possibly, over a sufficiently long period of time, they can present, cumulatively, a meaningful loss of freedom.Henry James wrote that the words, &quot;summer afternoon&quot; were the most pleasant in the English language. Take a summer afternoon (or two) to read this euphonious essay for a refreshing breather from the cacophony of Howard Stern, Don Imus, and their local knock-offs; follow-up news stories on Viagra; Judge Judy; infomercials; network news; and the culture of money, sex, power, and fame hustled by the print and electronic media."

At the time jogging/running was becoming quite popular, so I took that up. I like to read so I read the Jim Fixx book on running which led me to Dr Cooper's book ""Aerobics"" (a term he coined), then to ""Aerobics Program for total Well Being..."", which became sort of a bible for a long time. After retirement I quit smoking and started going to a doctor. Found to be out of shape - again - I looked up Dr Cooper and saw his book ""Start Strong, Finish Strong"" which I absorbed like a sponge dropped in a bucket of water. Joined a gym and started the prescription of 55% aerobics, 45% strength and have never felt better. Now I've got one doctor trying to tie me down to hypertension drugs. That diagnosis was contrary to my own readings, so I'm in the middle of a complete cardio workup. (The initial stress test results were great, waiting for the in depth analysis.) When I saw this book it was a gotta have.In this book Dr. Cooper very thoughtfully presents all factors in a very helpful manner with a goal of controlling blood pressure without medications, but points out factors that could make them necessary. After my first reading I feel like I can more intelligently discuss the stress test results with my cardiologist, then better deal with my general physician.I would hardily, strongly recommend this book for any person who has had a too high blood pressure reading."

As a resident of Kodiak,Alaska I have been lucky enough to get some of Ruth Allmans sourdough starter. I have tried her receipes and all I can say is , wow! San Francisco look out. You get a real sense of the struggle of the pioneers with this book, and the way she describs the receipes, you can just imagine spreading the butter and jam on the bread. My favorite receipe is the hot griddle cakes with fresh strawberries. As Ruth says, the art of mixing the batter with air, and the timing of slopping it on the grill is a skill learned over time. The Baked Alaska with sourdough waffles (which by the way is how it was actually first made) is a dessert from heaven. This is a book that every sourdough making Alaskan owns."	R

The stories were informative, a fascinating look at history, and most of all - FUN! Then, because she made it sound so easy and delectable - I decided to try making sourdough and see what would happen. I had to go back and forth in the book a little to make sure I was doing everything correctly - the Sourdough Hints in the back were very helpful. Well, it's been a week since I mixed up the starter. The sourdough smelled ""sour cream sour"" and it looked OK. (I was glad not to see little black fungus or other such nasties growing on the surface like the last sourdough I tried to make 20 years ago). So I made the Quick Sourdough Bread today. I figured that was a good place to start since I didn't want to take time for the 2 risings that the regular Sourdough Bread recipe called for. It rose nicely in the pan. It smelled good. But I did take it out of the oven 10 minutes early, because it was a deep golden brown and I was afraid it would be a rock-hard loaf if I waited the full 45 minutes. I brushed butter on the crust to soften it a little (still paranoid about the possible hard crust) and waited for it to cool. I sliced it. My husband and I had one slice. Then we had another. (And, yes, then we had one more with black cherry jam!) Oh My Goodness!! I haven't had bread that tasted that good in a LONG time!! My husband put it this way, ""It is a slice of Heaven!"". I agreed wholeheartedly - better than candy, cake or cookies! So take it from a person who has hundreds of cook books and probably thousands of recipes and has cooked all sorts of bread for the last 30+ years - this book is worth getting. It made the best bread we have ever eaten and now I can't wait to try some of the other recipes in the book. Four thumbs up."	R

I've tried two of the four bread recipes so far and neither have performed well. One recipe calls for 8 to 10 cups of flour, which I halved, and so attempted 4 to 5 cups. At 3 cups, my dough was full. Okay, yes, great variety of atmospheres and starter consistency, yes, but the next recipe was like that too. And my sponge has not raised a mm in 24 hours.

The ""sourdough lore"" is very interesting but in order to make the book seem more ""authentically old"" the author has hand-written each and every page. That's right, the only thing typed in this book is the copyright info. Her handwriting is more or less legible but it's much more difficult to read at a glance and the frequent misspellings bother me. The instructions also assume that you already know how to do a lot of things. For example, on the recipe for doughnuts it says to mix the ingredients, allow to rise, and the deep fry the cut doughnuts. I have to cut doughnuts? Is there anything I do to them first? I don't know, because none of that is included in the recipe. Also, there is no master index.Finally, all the recipes I have gone through are scaled to make massive portions. There is no eating for two out of this cookbook and you can't cut them down because they call for an odd number of eggs. Example - the pancake recipe will make about 15-20 medium sized pancakes (and calls for two cups of sourdough starter - not workable for people who don't have huge batches of starter) yet calls for only 1 egg.UPDATE: After working with this cookbook more, I wish I could have given it a lower review. It's not really a cookbook as there are probably only about 5 unique recipes. Everything else is a VARIATION that she calls a new recipe. And some of her suggestions are just plain gross. Corned beef and Worcestershire pancakes? Cottage cheese and smoked fish pancake roll ups? Ick! There are about 10,000 things she recommends doing with waffles but these are not unique recipes - these are tips, hints, and VARIATIONS.

Alaska Sourdough	Alaska Sourdough,,A7IA8CTTSQ7A4,Kenneth Montgomery,3/5,3.0,1290470400,Sourdough...Alaska style,"Frankly, ""Alaska Sourdough"" will not suit everyone's tastes. Don't get me wrong, ""Alaska Sourdough"" is as much interesting from an historical standpoint as it is for the unique recipes derived from ""on the trail"" sourdoughs who purportedly derived these concoctions over many, many years of preserving their stock of sourdough. One gets the feeling that sourdough was the lifeblood--the sustaining force--that kept many of Alaska's intrepid miners and inevitable shysters alive when all other earthly endeavors and pleasures had evaporated.The unique uses for sourdough (makes a wonderful glue, did you know?) keeps the book moving forward, and the recipes can be a bit bizarre, especially the numerous uses of mixing clams in pancake and muffin recipes. If you're looking for more practical recipes, Ruth Allman includes those as well in what appears to be a handwritten book, simulating the feel of recipes jotted down on note cards or loose pieces of paper. The section on waffles and pancakes I found to be very useful; however, the section on creating basic sourdough bread seemed to be laborious compared to the many no-knead methods other sourdough experts espouse. A good sourdough starter is its own leavening agent, creating a dough that will rise on its own. Allman's recipes frequently encourage the use of baking soda, baking powder, and even commercial yeast to speed up the respective recipe processes. This concept might not set too well with traditional sourdough bakers.""Alaska Sourdough"" does not take too long to peruse. After doing so, I did a little research on Ruth Allman and her husband and found their influence to be substantial in the Juneau, Alaska community in the early 20th Century. I would encourage anyone who found the historical aspect of ""Alaska Sourdough"" to be compelling to look into the House of Wickersham and Ruth Allman's interesting involvement in its development and perpetuation."

The Oxford Handbook of Free Will (Oxford Handbooks)	The Oxford Handbook of Free Will (Oxford Handbooks),,A1MEHQSDHEI882,Michael McKenna,26/27,5.0,1105574400,Robert Kane's *The Oxford Handbook on Free Will*,"Do you want to brought up to speed on the state of the art in philosophical discussions of free will? Do you want to give yourself a top-flight graduate course on this exciting philosophical topic? Then read Robert Kane's The Oxford Handbook on Free Will. This book might be the single best book to study if one wants a comprehensive overview of most of the controversies unfolding in debates about free will and moral responsibility. The essays are all outstanding. Each is penned by one of the leading figures in the field, and each combines an effort to teach at a very advanced level with a novel contribution to the literature pitched from the perspective of the author. For example, in the section devoted to compatibilism (the view that free will and moral responsibility are compatible with determinism), Kane includes four essays, one by Bernard Berofsky, another by Ishtiyaque Haji, a third by Paul Russell, and a forth by Daniel Dennett and Christopher Taylor. Each essay is detailed, crisp, completely informed, and clear as a bell. Each also advances the author's own views. Reading through this section, one can learn exactly what is now taking place in the arena of compatibilism. The same can be said about the section devoted to libertarianism (the thesis that some persons act from a sort of free will that requires the falsity of determinism). In this section, Kane includes probably the four finest philosophers currently defending this topic, Tim O'Connor, Randy Clarke, Carl Ginet, and Kane himself.In all, there are eight sections to Kane's collection with a total of 25 essays. The sections are devoted to the following topics: 1) theological issues as they pertain to free will, 2) theories of physics and the free will problem, 3) the consequence argument (a highly influential argument for the thesis that determinism is incompatible with the ability to do otherwise), 4) compatibilism, 5) the relevance of alternative possibilities for moral responsibility (some philosophers think that the freedom to act otherwise is not required for moral responsibility), 6) libertarian views, 7) non-standard views about the relationship between free will, moral responsibility and determinism (such as the view that no one has free will or moral responsibility regardless of the truth or falsity of determinism), and finally, 8) neuroscientific influences on our understanding of the free will topic. An impressive range of topics indeed.I have been publishing and writing on the topics of free will and moral responsibility for over 10 years now and I simply know of no single collection that even approximates the impressive quality and breadth of Kane's handbook. It is an outstanding book."	R

Robert Kane has certainly done his part to keep up the trend.All of the essays in this volume are written by philosophers who have made significant individual contributions to the contemporary discussion about human freedom. Most of the authors have also produced influential works in related fields (philosophy of mind, action theory and moral psychology), and many of them are thoroughly conversant with the relevant empirical research in physics and neuroscience. Indeed, parts II and VIII of the book are dedicated, respectively, to the interplay between the problems of free will and quantum physics/chaos theory on the one hand, and recent work in neuroscience on the other. The result is a compilation of essays written with the sort of texture and philosophical sensitivity that repays careful (re-)reading, and brimming with suggestive ideas that could well move the debate into some relatively unexplored terrain. (We should expect nothing less from a volume edited by Kane, who has himself long advocated the importance of approaching the ancient problem of free will from novel directions.) What's more, the collection includes essays from several philosophers whose own books on free will are, though quite important and valuable, somewhat cost prohibitive. (Anyone living on a graduate student's salary who's tried to pick up a copy of Pereboom's or Clarke's or Double's or Strawson's books will know what I mean.) So the expense of the present volume is, when seen in that light, thoroughly justifiable. In fact it's a steal! Or so I've tried to convince my wife.Finally, with his characteristic combination of clarity and rigor, Kane provides a lengthy introduction to the book that will help both the professional philosopher and the new-comer find their bearings in this complex debate with as little intellectual turmoil as can reasonably be hoped for. The book is a good one, highly recommended."	R

Erickson,18/19,5.0,1105315200,Kane's Compilation Will Leave You Proud To Lose An Argument,"I first encountered Bob Kane's skill with the daedal discipline of free will in his book *The Significance of Free Will.* At that time, I realized that Kane had an almost suspicious talent for articulating my own objections, and then articulating a response that would often satisfy me more than my own.While such a talent may be a bit threatening for readers aiming to claim their own victories, Kane's affability and enthusiasm always leave the reader not only with the necessary knowledge, but with a sense of pride in having participated in his well-authenticated jaunts.This work, in particular, highlights Kane's skills as both an original author and an editor with an honest eye for the best arguments of his opponents. It will certainly become a staple, if it has not already, for professional scholars of free will and curious by-standers alike. The *Oxford Handbook of Free Will* draws together balanced selections from the most relevant authors in the field, and-despite its depth-manages to cover a range broad enough that the book would be equally well placed on the shelves of theologians, philosophers, and physicians.My main criticism is that the compilation elides some selections that, to me, seem indispensable. Then again, such a problem *should* be inevitable for a field as factious as free will, and is blunted by Kane's need to balance his equations.The Oxford group has again demonstrated their wisdom in selecting Kane as the editor of this volume. Compared to its competitors in the prosy pantheon of free-will texts, this selection will leave you energized to gnaw through the next puzzle (rather than feeling deflated by the fact that there remain more arguments to be broached).-Christian P.

It was useful for planning as well as a take-along guide. We traveled by train, and the book was great for ""getting our heads in the game"" for the next stop. The pictures are rich with detail, including cut-away views of many historical structures like castles and cathedrals. The historical synoptic narratives are extremely well written, delivering maximum information in the space available. The quality of the paper is impeccable, with a glossy finish and gorgeous colors.My 13-year old daughter, unexpectedly and unprompted, devoured the book during the train rides. She set aside her DVD player and forty or so movies, and focused on the book - day, after day, after day. She never watched a movie on the trains. When she finished studying the section on our next city, she moved outward in the book to other features of the country. She would go back and forth between the various city descriptions, the country maps, and the map of Europe. We would go into museums, and she would point out pictures she had seen in the book. Eventually, she had carefully looked over every page of the book and read far more than just what was relevant to our destinations. She probably reread the section on Anne Frank 10 times, even though we didn't get to Amsterdam and she has already read two books on the subject. Tomorrow morning, a Saturday with me off work, she and I are going to sit down together and go through the book, tabbing the sections that cover places we went. At the expense of sounding schmaltzy, I expect it will be a sentimental keepsake for the rest of her life.This is a great book for early planning, especially if you haven't decided on which cities to visit. On the other hand, if you've already made up your mind and you are visiting fewer than four cities, this is probably not the book for you - you wouldn't buy an encyclopedia if you only wanted to read three articles. Buying the book early can give you time to buy a more focused book for cities where you find you need more information.The binding on the book will appear somewhat unusual if you're unfamiliar with this publisher as I was. Sitting on a bookshelf, it looks like a hardbound book in a colorful dust jacket, even though there is no removable jacket at all. In fact, it is sort of a hybrid between a paperback and a hardbound book. The cover is actually vinyl: solid but flexible and looks and feels almost like it is plastic coated. The cover extends above and below the pages like a hard cover. One negative is that it is fairly heavy for a relatively small book. This is because of the 800, full-color, glossy pages in a book that is less than 1.25 inches thick. The other dimensions are roughly 8.5 X 5.25.I'm sorry, but I've got to take a shot at some of the negative reviews. Some criticized a lack of depth. What do you expect with 20 countries covered in 800 pages and content split between pictures, historical narrative, and touring advice that gets all the way down to restaurants and shopping? This book is a careful compromise between breadth and depth. (Our next trip will be to only three cities, and we'll buy more focused books then.) Frankly, I don't see how the publishers could have crammed more information into such a compact space. To the fellow who said the only Eastern European country covered was Czechoslovakia: (1) it's the Czech Republic, and (2) are Hungary and Poland not part of Eastern Europe? To the person who said the maps were not useful, I have to point out that maps that can actually help navigation typically can't fit on pages this small. What do you want, 200 foldout maps in an 800 page book?BTW, we brought along a set of maps that we had bought online. Surprisingly to us, we ended up mostly relying on the free ones available in the three, four, and five star hotels we stayed in. We never failed to get a good map from a hotel front desk or concierge. Even after all the preliminary study (also, my wife and I had been to most of the cities before), we often asked for suggestions on sites and several times made some new discoveries that way. We brought along a Garmin GPS, but used it very little because we were on foot, and the Garmin instructions used street names while the streets were often unmarked. (Try looking on the sides of buildings for street names.)Bottom Line: You are investing a significant amount of money, time, and sweat equity in your trip. While it isn't cheap as books go, in the greater context of trip expenses, this book is practically free. Probably the most significant cost is the weight allowance it eats up. (Put it in your carry-on; the airlines haven't started weighing those yet.) In the uses that I've described, it can significantly enhance your experience. When you get back, it will look good on your bookshelf. If you are still deciding on which cities to go to, or if you are going to more than a few cities, buy this book. You'll thank yourself, again and again, just as I thanked my wife.Bon voyage ..... buon viaggio ..... ibuen viaje ..... and, lest we forget, ..... gute fahrt!"	R

All of them have tons of images, walking routes throught various cities, contact information for sites, hotel listings, resturants, and in many cases floor plans of museums and other buildings. I also like the fact that they give some history of the country, show images of the currancy, list suggested times to visit very busy sites and show some of the reasons why you would select to visit particular attractions.True this book does not cover all of Europe, but it does have sections on the more ""popular"" travel destinations. It is good if you want some general information on many different countries and to help determine which you have interest in visiting. It is not to large to carry around and has extended cover flaps to help mark the section.The last thing is that if you are traveling to only one country or going to spend a most of your time in one city, look for the individual eyewitness guides. The information in the Ireland book was better for the two week visit to Ireland, where this book (the Europe book) would have been only ok for that trip, but was perfect for the three days in Edinburgh and helping to select which countries to visit when we only had time for a few days in each."

The book covers mainly Western Europe along with Poland, Czech Republic, Hungry, and Greece. The former Soviet Union, former Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia are not covered and neither are the islands of Iceland, Malta, and Cyprus. Similarly, of the ""tiny"" countries, only Monaco and the Vatican are mentioned; Liechtenstein, Andorra, and San Marino are not.The book describes what is available to see in Europe. For each country, about six to twenty cities/regions are discussed and for major cities (e.g. London, Paris, Amsterdam, Venice, etc.) there is more detailed coverage, such as six to twenty sights within that city along with a city map. Usually, each attraction gets about a four-paragraph write-up plus a photograph. A few major attractions (e.g. Louvre, British Museum, St. Peter's Cathedral, etc.) are devoted two to four pages plus a larger diagram. Also, each country usually has another dozen or so pages covering its history and culture as well as a discussion about practical information such as climate, banking, methods of travel, shopping, etc.The book doesn't teach you everything you need to know about Europe (e.g. nothing about foreign languages), or will want to know (e.g. hotels, restaurants, and food have modest coverage). Nor does it include everything you'll do - only places, not events, are written about (e.g. Oktoberfest only warrants a photo). But the book does an excellent job at detailing what popular, famous, interesting, or important places there are in Europe. The pictures and illustrations make the book come to life. The maps help you judge the relative positions of sights within a particular city. The descriptions are usually detailed enough so you can determine how interesting you'll find a particular place. Some people might criticize the book because it doesn't judge how ""good"" each sight is. However, I find this nice because everyone has different tastes and I like to have the opportunity form my own opinions.If you want to know what is available to see in Europe then this is the book for you."

Unless of course you happen to be traveling with someone who knows the country and I can imagine that is the best way to travel. Is there a lonely Frenchman out there who wants to show me Paris? SighJust kidding, but hey, a fantasy is a fantasy.So, think of this guide as an overview and then you can select an Eyewitness Travel Guide for the specific countries of interest. They are all excellent although on a first trip to Europe, I'd advice a guided tour so you can enjoy your trip instead of worrying about language barriers, etc.If you go to Paris, take a tour because I would not drive there if you paid me a million bucks! The highways in Germany are also equally terrifying. Everyone is in such a hurry to get to nowhere. If you want to enjoy your vacation without as many hassles, a tour might be the way to go. There is nothing quite like being guided through the most gorgeous cities in Europe.This guide is just the start to many adventures.~The Rebecca Review"	R

This is a handy guide to Europe and shows some of the more popular spots to travel to. I was a bit confused that not all countries were included. However, that might be because they picked the places that most people travel to. I personally was a bit disapointed that Romania, Ukraine and other more far eastern european countries were not included. However, still and all, this is an awesome guide for the countries that are included. I love how they show everything instead of just writing and writing like many travel guides do. These are the best guides out there and the many photos make these guides stupendous and astounding and many leagues better then closest competitor."	R

ZAIDI ""Ali Zaidi""",11/13,4.0,1033689600,Helpful guide on tours through Europe,"I recently took a backpack trip through Europe, which lasted close to a month; before heading out there I went through a few guidebooks and at that moment this one appealed the most. I cannot say if it was the presentation with the colored photographs; maps of the cities with visitor information or that I was just to plain sick of spending time searching for a guide book to take me though my journey. Nonetheless I am quite pleased that I took this guide with me. I had planned initially to visit a friend in Netherlands and spend some time scrolling through the cities; I left my guide there to my host; but off and on I would reference the book with places I visited; I must admit that this book covered all the places. Now of course I personally feel the best way to visit a place is to have some one show you around as like any other travel guide will not detail the places where the locals would head over to; like the bars, restraunts and night clubs. My visit from here lead me to Paris; it hit me with all its charm and glamour; here too I was fortunate to be taken around by friends. The real use of the guide came when I went on a solo journey to Belgium Austria and Italy. I found this guide an immense source of information. On my way to the city mostly by trains; I found the chance to orient myself and somewhat have a time frame as to how long I would stay in each city. I found that even though the book has information about hotels and hostels but at the train station's Hotel Guides; I was always able to get better deals. Pretty much I carried this heavy 800 pages book with me where ever I went.Even though this book provides immense information I would highly recommend getting additional reference books on cities, which are known, for immense sightseeing and historical attractions. One such place where the guide fell short was Florence; even tough it has considerable information and provides all the most popular sites. It literally will take a 1000 pages to detail all the places to visit; as a comparison there are over 78 places to visit which have historical importance but the book has listed only about the best 14 of them; well visiting all the places would take a few weeks of stay in comparison to a typical 3-4 days that tourists generally spend; which is sufficient time to visit the places listed in the book. Another important place not mentioned in this test was the ""Museum of Arsenal"" in Vienna; here on display is the car in which duke Ferdinand traveled with in Sarajevo.On the whole this covers only the most western countries of Europe and leaves a lot of East European countries and Turkey as well."

It should be used to maybe narrow down places to visit- then more comprehensive guides should be used. I have never been a believer in those 1 and 2 days in 18 cities over 3 weeks tours. 1 or 2 days is certainly not enough time to fully appreciate and get to know any city you visit. Furthermore, this guides biggest flaw is in doesn't cover anything in central/eastern europe besides the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary! Where's Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, the Baltic States, etc....? Yes, Europe is big but the countries not contained in this guide have so much to offer and certainly should not be overlooked. For example, St. Petersburg is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe - not mentioned here!Don't rush Europe - relax and enjoy it. Take time to get to know the people and cities.

I do enjoy the pictures and diagrams in the book. I highly recommend having another guide book that covers more logistics. I used this book along with Rick Steves Europe 2007. They were great companions to one another. My other complaint is that I am a student with a budget. This book does not cover many (if any) cheap places to eat or sleep. It does tell you which places charge admission, but does not tell you the admission price. It is a great book when accompanied by another (like Lonely Planet or Rick Steves.)"	R

Any archer's heart will race at the reaccounting of each hunt, but only archers of traditional caliber will be able to appreciate the flight of the arrow as it's loosed and hits its intended mark. The bond between fellow hunters is well expressed and gives proper account to the knowledge and wisdom passed down at the campfire by older more experienced hunters.

This is not a book an enthustiastic &quot;Wicca&quot; would be enjoyed or feel excited to read. Rather it is a well organized collection of historical accounts (mostly dealing with the &quot;Western&quot; side of the subject) and esoteric knowledge.

All sections concerning with ancient cultures has very interesting details on ancient rituals, myths and the concept of &quot;demons&quot;. He especially provides very interesting material on Hermetic philosophy and gnosticism. The hundreds of illustrations in the book, add an entertaining taste into the story.

First, in Williams, you have an intriguing, mysterious figure who not many people have much information on. Yes, he won the Heisman trophy and he is, publically, seen as a good person.What Richardson, the most respected college sports writer in the country, is able to do is look beyond the public perception and give readers a sense of what makes Williams tick and why Williams ticks the way he does.This book sets the stage for Williams in New Orleans. It is set before Williams' rookie year with the Saints and controversial coach Mike Ditka. After reading this book, you'll understand why Williams had the turbulent year and subsequent problems.Through a network of what seem to be unparalled contacts, Richardson is able to gain an insight on Williams the college player that has never before been exposed. He sets the table for Williams' rookie year. Much of the book explains how Williams was handled in college at Texas and why his transition to the real world has been so difficult.In short, this book is a must for any pro football fan.

It is so practical and really applies to any age of child/adult and parenting style. The goal of the book is to empower kids (and parents) to be responsible for their own feelings by identifying and handling them in appropriate ways.A variety of techniques are recommended depending on the age of the child and the child's own particular personality. (From art to music to reading to physical exercises and so much more).The author suggests that for each year of age a child has, they should develop that many coping mechanisms when they are upset for how to get their feelings under control and process them.This book strikes an excellent balance between the one extreme that says ""You have no business feeling that way - just deal with it"" which leads to stuffing emotions and angry outbursts, and the other extreme which focuses so much on talking about feelings ""You're angry, you're upset, tell me how you feel, let's focus on your feelings for hours ad nauseum"" that the child feels trapped by their own feelings and isn't given tools for moving beyond the situation.Highly highly recommend this book! You as the parent will also come away with new and better coping skills for yourself."	R

A friend asked me about it, and when forced to confront my ignorance on the subject I purchased the book to correct that shortcoming. Little did I know how much I was about to be entertained!Voices from The Farm is written--as a book on the communal living experience should be--by a number of the folks who participated. It is a collection of stories that together summarize the experience of the members, and the life-cycle of the community.The Farm and its various off-shoots accomplished some great humanitarian feats in the face of the suspicion and prejudice of its neighbors. Winning over those neighbors provides some of the most entertaining tales in the book. However, the biggest obstacles seem--as with human society in general--to be rooted in the human nature of the members of The Farm community.This book is a great, entertaining collection of stories that together tell the tale of a marvelous exercise in social science and community economics. Excellent work by the editors in preserving, selecting, and arranging the individual contributions to tell the story of The Farm."	R

While no book can EVER be a substitute for the daily reality of living on the land, trying to build a community, take care of children, raise food and get through cold winters, reading this book was still a very powerful experience. It made me think about my spiritual values and what it must have been like for those who were trying to live with a commitment to living gently on the earth, not hurting wild creatures, not using leather.I appreciated the honesty as well - as varous people would talk of giving into corruption and sneaking Dr. Pepper soda on a trip to town and other acts that went against general group values. Some of these values, of course were not overtly stated...but most were understood. Others were in a state of transition.Ultimately, the Farm broke up but this book is a powerfl reminder of all that was good about it and of the yearning for finding new ways of building stronger community lives. I have no way of knowing for sure, but I have a feeling many members of The Farm continue to live with similar values as they had back then, when they were simply thought of as crazy ""hippies""."	R

The Farm had a fairly hierarchical structure compared to some hippie efforts, and identified as a spiritual community, with a large amount of group effort and work involved in basic infrastructure, social experiments, and, eventually, charity projects that were difficult for the cash-strapped group to support (like maintaining an ambulance service in besieged Bronx neighborhoods, hundreds of miles from the Farm home base in Tennessee, as well as projects in Central America during a guerrilla war that threatens local partners in the project).The stories are a FANTASTIC look at group dynamics and, in my opinion, give a great look at the consequences of the ""mission creep"" that idealistic projects such as nonprofits and religious organizations are prone to. Much of this is very entertaining, often in a black-humor sort of way, and gives a great look at commonalities in human nature that apply today, whether to today's version of 'hippies', or any hard-working and idealistic group of humans trying to better the world."

The Battleship Bismarck	The Battleship Bismarck,34.95,A30IUAABSEHEPI,Lawrence Duckles,9/9,3.0,1055980800,The Battleship Bismarck reviewed,"This book is both a history and a photo album of the famous German battleship, and the photos are particularly useful in showing both the construction stages of the ship and for the many interior shots. That said, this book has a couple of problems. One is its age; it was originally published in 1975, and the authors appear not to have taken advantage of the information that appears in Ludovic Kennedy's ""Pursuit,"" published the previous year. As a result, there are statements in this book, particularly concerning the Bismarck's chronology, that have been disproved by more recent discoveries. The other big problem is the translation, which appears to have been done very literally by someone with little knowledge of naval nomenclature. Thus, ""Seekriegsleitung"" gets translated as ""sea-war-leadership,"" which may be a literal translation, but ignores the more generic term ""naval operations,"" which is what this really means. This problem becomes particularly aggravating in trying to follow the time-line of events surrounding the destruction of the Hood and the Bismarck, which, as translated, make almost no sense. The diagrams, which are in German and are not translated, seem fairly accurate, although during the destruction of the Bismarck they appear to show the King George V firing torpedos at the Bismarck, when in fact the King George V had no torpedo tubes. It's also puzzling that the translator, according to the note at the end of the book, was unaware until 1989, with the publication of Robert Ballard's book on the discovery of the Bismarck, of the number of German sailors rescued after the sinking of the Bismarck. Even here, his figures are wrong--he states that 115 men were rescued by the British. In fact, British warships rescued 111 men (one later died and was buried at sea) while a German submarine and a German weather ship rescued the other five. A marginally useful book, although much of its information has been supersceded by more recent discoveries and research."	R

Barker demands faith and effort, but at its core, the method really does not differ much from techniques in cognitive therapy and sqaures with the latest views on neuroplasticity, at least in my view.

Allen owns one of the most successful software companies in the world, which now has made him the target of threats. The man sending threatening letters is obviously brilliant, unbalanced and dangerous. Concerned for his daughter, Alan wants someone to keep an eye on Prudence night and day to ensure her safety. But Micah must protect Prudence without her knowledge. She has struggled hard to establish her independence from her father and won't welcome his intrusion now, however well meaning.Micah moves into the apartment across the hall from Prudence, using his proximity to arrange quiet dinners and intimate moments. By necessity, Prudence believes he's courting her, and is confused by his mixed signal when he kisses her on one day and then emotionally distances himself the next. Micah is equally confused by his reactions, knowing that emotional involvement can endanger her safety. Prudence becomes the cause of some real soul searching, as their relationship takes a path he didn't expect. As danger escalates, Micah finds not just her life in danger, but his heart. Further, she won't be tolerant when she finds out her father hired him.Ruth Langan deftly combines danger and romance in BY HONOR BOUND. Langan has a gift for creating wonderful characters. The direct confrontation of the ethical issues provides striking characterizations with believable dilemmas. Her secondary characters likewise sparkle, from the Lassiter family to the meddlesome sisters that live in the same apartment building as Alan and Prudence.

Tess and the Highlander	Tess and the Highlander,,A2VCGJLKGK2WJJ,Rebecca Herman,17/18,5.0,1035244800,My new favorite book from the Avon True Romance series.,"Tess was washed ashore on the Isle of May during a terrible storm eleven years ago, presumed to be the only survivor of a shipwreck. Just six years old at the time, Tess had buried horrible memories deep within her, and remembered little of what brought her to the island. An elderly couple living on the island raised her and taught her to be self-sufficient. But now they are dead, and Tess is all alone on the island. She longs for human companionship but has learned to fear the world beyond the Isle of May. When a young Highlander washes ashore in a storm, Tess feels compelled to save him. At twenty years of age, Colin Macpherson is the youngest son of a Highland laird. He's been restlessly roaming the seas, but when he washes up on Tess's island, everything changes. As Colin helps Tess remember her past, he finds himself drawn to her as he's never been drawn to a woman before. And Tess is discovering strong feelings for him as well, feelings that may very well be love. But when they return to the mainland in search of Tess's heritage, will they be able to stay together, or will they be torn apart?Set in Scotland in 1543, this is my new favorite book in the Avon True Romance series. The love story between Tess and Colin was so romantic and incredibly sweet, and I LOVED the setting. If you are a fan of the Avon True Romance series, or like historical romances for teens, this book is a must-read."	R
Tess and the Highlander	Tess and the Highlander,,,,9/9,5.0,1041638400,An awesome novel from May McGoldrick,"After enjoying a previous Avon True Romance, Gwyneth and the Thief, I decided to read more from the series. I thought Gwyneth was great, but this is even better yet. Tess is a seventeen-year-old who lives on the Isle of May. She was taken under the care of a couple who oversaw the island, but they have died, and she is completely alone. One day, she finds that a young man is washed ashore, and drags him from the water. She does not want to be near him, as she was warned to stay away from all men, so she hides on the island. Colin Macpherson, a highlander, searches for the young lady who rescued him. Tess is stubborn, but eventually they get to know one another. Tess does not know much about her past, with the exception of nightmares which give small recollections. Colin realizes that Tess is part of the Lindsay clan, and when a ship comes to rescue him from the island, Tess goes with him, in order to find the life she was taken away from eleven years ago. Will she be able to have peace, and be with Colin, the person she has grown to love? Read this very interesting novel to find out. I really enjoyed reading this.

It's the type of thing I would have swooned over as a teenager, had I deigned to read romances at that age (I admit, I had a bit of book snobbery going on, though I secretly loved any romance I could find in books I read). As an adult, now, I read the book and think it's cute.

The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book.

"A Dose of Sanity: Mind	"A Dose of Sanity: Mind, Medicine, and Misdiagnosis",30.00,A1E8JE7ZU91ZS5,John Bolender,20/20,4.0,935971200,Much more sensible than most books critical of the field.,"This is not the first book I've read that is critical of psychiatry. But compared to Caplan, Breggin, and Szasz, this is the most sensible critique I've seen. Usually, in the anti-psychiatry literature one finds inexcusible nonsequiturs. For example: ""Psychiatrists often don't realize that the medication is causing the disorder (good point). Therefore, biological psychatry is unsound (bad point)."" Or ""Psychiatric illnesses are voted on by committee (good point), therefore there is no such thing as mental illness (bad point)."" Walker avoids making such obvious nonsequiturs. Far from being against biological psychiatry, Walker argues that current psychiatry is not biological enough. It appeals to highly hypothetical conditions (such as neurotransmitter disorders) while ignoring known conditions (such as pin worms or hypothyroidism). Some might think that this is all that Walker is saying, but his general point seems to be that since psychiatrists are taught to run through symptoms lists instead of being medical detectives, there a lot of unknown conditions which they are failing to discover."	R
"A Dose of Sanity: Mind	"A Dose of Sanity: Mind, Medicine, and Misdiagnosis",30.00,,,12/13,4.0,893203200,Fascinating and Terrifying,"Dr. Walker's book is a stern indictment of the contemporary medical profession and the mental health field in particular. He charges the majority of psychiatrists of ignoring the true needs of their patients and instead practicing and arbitrary pseudo-science of labeling. They seem to have given up on the idea (fundamental to the philosophy of science)that all events have a cause and that to understand something we must understand the process of cause and effect that brought it into being. Most modern psychiatrists are not interested in finding out what is wrong through careful methodology. They are divided into two camps. The psychoanalytic types deny a medical cause for abnormal feelings and behaviour altogether (however, they still want the prestige that comes with being a medical doctor!). They look everything from a bad childhood to alien abductions to explain such things as psychosis and manic depression, even though no scientific study has ever proven the theories on which their claims are based. The next group, the standard issue biopsychiatrists are a little more up to date. They would admit the obvious scientific truth that someone who hears voices or is immobilized by a deep depression is psysically ill. However, they drop the ball as well. Most biologically based psychiatrists give very vague answers about the causes of mental illness, and rely on a few biological treatments which are tried on the patient almost randomly until one seems to &quot;work&quot;. For instance, a depressed person will be given one antidepressant drug after another without the doctor even stopping to consider that the deprssion may result from anemia, a thyroid imbalance, poor nutrition or a host of other causes. Many psyciatric patients today are not even given a blood test, an EEG or any other genuine medical test before traetment is prescribed. Walker points out that until people are given a battery of tests, we will never really know what is wrong with them. Prozac or tranquilizers may make the! m feel better temporatily, but they could be literally dying. He also attacks the concepts of hypochodndria and facetious disorder. For the most part, he argues, these are destructive labels used to protect doctors and stigmatized patients (&quot;if I can't figure out what is wrong with you then it is all in you're head and/or you are just making it up&quot;) While I don't agree with all his points (for instance, his extreme anti-prozac position) I must say that this book is must reading for anyone in need of mental health care."	R
"A Dose of Sanity: Mind	"A Dose of Sanity: Mind, Medicine, and Misdiagnosis",30.00,,,9/11,4.0,983059200,"Informative, but left me wanting more","I was very impressed with A Dose of Sanity because so many books critical of psychiatry remind me of Breggin which claim that there is something &quot;spiritual&quot; missing in the patient, and the author ignores the bioligical problems inherent in the behavioral or mood disorder.However, I as I made my way through the book I was concerned that Dr. Walker was not going to address what to do if you have been diagnosed with a serious mood disorder, but were unable to find a physical cause (like a boy that was ADHD but had cardiac problems). I was right. He never said what to do if you have been diagnosed with manic depression (or any of the other hard to treat mood disorders). He did not address lithium or other non-antidepressant therapies for mood disorders. I agree that these treatments are probably only treating the symptoms of some underlying brain dysfunction that science has not yet named, but what does the patient do until science has figured this out? Remain psychotic? Lithium therapy may be some band-aid solution for a cellular dysfunction of our brain matter, but is a patient supposed to discontinue this medication because science can only offer this treatment to help the symptoms of the disorder? I wish Walker had offered an opinion and information on this issue.Also, along the same line, he didn't say what patients should do once they had gone through exstensive medical testing to determine their problem and nothing physically wrong was found. (Nevermind the fact that he did't give specific tests to ask for - just blood and urinalysis in addition to what else?) If you know that you don't suffer from pin worms, syphillis, typhus, cardiac problems or whatever else, but your symptoms only seem to match typical manic symptoms that only lithium helps, should you throw in the towel and accept the psychotropic medication?I do think that Dr. Walker is truly concerned about patients who have fallen victim to DSM &quot;diagnosis&quot;, and this book could be very helpful for a patient who has received psychiatric care, but did not have a full medical work-up before taking psychotropic medications. I only wish this book had touched on the issues that I mentioned above.Finally, the most important message of this book is never stop learning about what you have been told your disorder is, and never take the word of your doctor as law. As Walker says himself, there is no way that one doctor can know everthing about medicine."	R
"A Dose of Sanity: Mind	"A Dose of Sanity: Mind, Medicine, and Misdiagnosis",30.00,A18TBJTWXAFKBN,Mira de Vries,1/1,3.0,1310256000,Somatic medicine as an alternative to psychiatry?,"Walker's book rests on two main themes. One is that theDSM, in spite of its name, is not a diagnostic manual at all, but a catalogue of descriptive labels that serve as an excuse for abandoning further medical investigation. He calls the DSM ""a cookbook listing of symptoms that has replaced the science of differential diagnosis.""The other theme divides into two parts. The minor one is that many people who are slapped with DSM labels and prescribed psychotropic drugs have nothing at all medically wrong with them.The major theme, however, and the main theme of the book next to criticism of the DSM, is that almost all cases of serious aberrations of feelings or behavior stem from physical causes such as genetic disease, hormonal imbalances, toxins, infection, parasites, and tumors. The DSM encourages psychiatrists to be lazy and overlook these causes, he says. Psychotropic drugs only mask them, and do more harm than good. Psychotherapy, including psychoanalysis, are totally useless for these conditions. Psychiatry should return to its true mission as practiced (according to Walker) by Emil Kraepelin and Benjamin Rush, namely to identify and treat the physical causes of insanity.I agree with Walker that cases of grossly aberrant behavior (as opposed to responses to stress) are probably due to unidentified physical causes. However, not identifying these causes is the failure of somatic medicine, not psychiatry. Psychiatry's mission has always been to sweep up after somatic medicine, and to sweep away society's rejects while it's at it.Walker maintains that there is a legitimate use of psychotropic drugs, but only in those extremely rare cases that the physical cause cannot be identified, or no curative treatment exists. My opposition to this contention is that far from being extremely rare, those are exactly all cases with which psychiatry deals. One of Walker's examples of physical disease which psychiatrists frequently fail to identify and treat is Tourette Syndrome, which he calls genetic. In spite of his own insistence that the causes of conditions should be scientifically sought, he fails to provide any evidence that TS is genetic in origin. Even if he had such evidence, since when does identifying conditions as genetic make them curable? On the other hand, Walker overlooks compelling evidence that TS is caused by brain damage: it is common in people whose brains have been damaged by psychotropic drugs. He doesn't mention how he thinks TS should be treated. In fact, the only ""treatment"" that exists, whether effective or not, is Haldol, the very type of treatment he claims to oppose except in those extremely rare cases, whichever they are.While correctly calling into question the efficacy and safety of psychiatric practice, Walker highly overrates somatic medicine. He attaches great diagnostic significance to gene mapping and brain scanning, whereas in reality such toys have as yet benefited no one but the doctors who employ them for research.One of Walker's more bombastic claims for successful treatment of aberrant behavior is ... surgically cleaning cholesterol out of a patient's brain arteries! (Who would be so gullible as to believe that?)Interesting to note are Walker's views on two of the greats among opponents to psychiatry, Peter Breggin and Thomas Szasz.Walker duly credits Breggin with having called attention to the horrific harm done by psychiatric drugs. Unfortunately, according to Walker (and I agree with him on this) the flip side to Breggin is blaming serious dysfunctional behavior on ""bad parenting."" No, not such obvious bad parenting as battering children or trading them for cocaine, but vague failures that only Breggin himself can identify, like paying insufficient attention to children. Walker might have added that those parents who are likely to seek psychiatric services, not to mention pay big bucks for them (a subject on which Breggin never touches), are the very parents who are deeply devoted to their children. Walker also criticizes Breggin for blaming schools, though schools are very much known to contribute to the ill-being of children.Contrary to his position on Breggin, Walker showers praise on Szasz, particularly for having been the first and the most relentless critic of DSM fake diagnoses. However, he feels Szasz goes too far in denying there is ever a physical origin for dysfunctional behavior, and by suggesting that such people are actually ""incompetent, lazy, or bad."" He presumes that Szasz would leave them to die in the streets and in jails, overlooking the fact that Szasz is the only writer in the field who has suggested a practical solution for dealing with such people, namely the non-medical asylum, or as Szasz nicknames it, the ""adult orphanage.""Those of you who are interested in ""alternative psychiatry"" may be interested in Walker's views on such treatments. He does not reject the idea outright, though he considers most of them quackery and downright silly. Acupuncture he calls effective in treating pain - but not curing the cause of pain.Orthomolecular medicinecan treat nutritional deficiency, but nothing else, he says.Walker further criticizes judges' reliance on psychiatric expertise. He says nothing about it that Szasz hasn't said before him. He does not mention involuntary commitment anywhere in the book.Finally, Walker calls on us, potential psychiatric patients, to take responsibility for our own health care. That's fine advice, but limited by the fact that responsibility can be carried out only in freedom. Massive state intervention in medicine means that much of his otherwise excellent advice is impossible to follow.All in all, this book's power is the author's ability to state in layman's language why theDSMis a fraud.Copyright MeTZelf"	R

Then there is an aloof South African &quot;Shrink&quot;,and his son,who wrote some book called &quot;Freud&quot;.

Chencinski,0/0,4.0,1208390400,King James Scores!,"Ryan Jones is a great basketball writer. In King James: The LeBron James Story he does a great job of trying to show the reader how amazingly good LeBron James is at basketball. Coach Bob Gibbons said about LeBron's performance in the Olympic trials, ""I don't want to blow too much smoke and distort the kid's thinking, but I saw Kobe Bryant in tenth and eleventh grades, and I think this kid is more advanced than Kobe was."" Like LeBron, Kobe Bryant was drafted out of high school and has led the Los Angeles Lakers to multiple NBA Championships.Ryan Jones is editor-in-chief at SLAM, the monthly basketball magazine that combined the sport with hip hop culture at a time when the genre was becoming increasingly popular. The magazine carries advertising for basketball-related products, street-wear clothing and hip hop music, and it has been credited with helping to market hip hop culture and basketball as one. It is only fitting that Ryan Jones wrote his first national magazine feature on LeBron James. He thoroughly explains LeBron's involvement with SLAM magazine throughout the book. He lives in New York with his wife and son.Although Jones seems a bit repetitive at times, his knowledge of basketball and great style shines though and creates an easy to read biography. In Chaper Four, he talks about the potential LeBron possessed in football as well as basketball: even though ""there wasn't much national buzz on LeBron the football player, area football coaches knew better."" Jones even compares him to the New England Patriots Pro-Bowl wideout, Randy Moss. While he mainly focuses on LeBron's basketball ability, his information about LeBron's high school football career is refreshing.With all the hype about LeBron and his constant coverage on ESPN, this book reveals the truth about LeBron and his journey from moving in with his friend's family to his 90 million dollar sneaker deal with Nike. While the vocabulary can be a bit easy at times, the book a joy to read, especially if you are a total sports nut like myself. A stong strength of Jones is to tell the complete story of every little event in Lebron's life. His very descriptive writing explains aspects of basketball that makes this book a good pick for sports lovers and non sports lovers alike. I give this book an eight out of ten and recommend it highly."	R

When he was a freshman in high school he won tournament MVP for the state, which is amazing.The beginning starts at his childhood and continues so on. My favorite part in the book is when he's a freshman and he played football. Their team made it to state. They lost in the finals, but he got All State. That means hes one of the best in the state. Later that year he made the basketball team. They made it to the state finals. They won and LeBron got MVP. That happened for the next three years.Ryan Jones is a senior editor at SLAM, the monthly basketball magazine. He lives in New York. I would recommend this book to sports fans that like LeBron James.

He has a big story on how he got to the NBA. LeBron was very poor growing up; his father left him and his mother when he was young. LeBron had to live with friends so his mom could work to keep a roof over their heads. A cool thing I thought LeBron did is when he was signing autographs an adult pushed over a kid just to get LeBrons signature but LeBron said ""Let me sign the kids first"". I think this shows LeBrons care for kids.When LeBron was in High School at St.Vincent St.Mary, the spotlight was on him. LeBron took the Irish to the state championship all four years of High School. LeBron played Football and Basketball in High School. He could of gone to college to be a star Wide Receiver but he chose Basketball. LeBron won the Mr.Basketball in Ohio award all four years in High School. I loved this book because LeBron never gave up at what he wanted to accomplish. LeaBron is a great role model to young kids because he never gave up and told himself that he could do it. LeBron now is in the NBA and won the Rookie of the Year award.Written by Gerald P.

The objective was clearly to tell LeBron James story, and the author does so fluidly and intelligently. The only issue I had when it came out was if LeBron warranted an entire book. Given that he's spent the first three quarters of his rookie season proving he may have even be underrated, consider the book warranted.

Building the timber frame house: The revival of a forgotten craft	Building the timber frame house: The revival of a forgotten craft,,A2ROJNY48QN55E,Reviewer,4/4,5.0,1230422400,Nearly three decades old and more relevant than ever,"This book was first written in 1980, though the philosophies presented between its covers are appropriate in these recent years of speculative energy prices and wobbling economic foundations. Timber frame house construction was ""green"" before that word was media-masticated and spit into popular culture.The book is well illustrated and instructive, and it is also well written. The authors have both experience and passion for this topic. The hand-drawn illustrations are well labeled with a drafting font that makes it interesting and captivating to read.The book begins with a historical review of this art, and slowly drills down to detailed diagrams of the many joining techniques. It is amazing that this old style of construction intuitively solved problems in structural mechanics without the need for finite element modeling, or even nails for that matter. The strength of this method of construction comes not from the size of the timbers (though they are substantial), but from the joints crafted from wood with axes, augers, and hammers. Timber framing is like cabinet building, but bigger.There are many detailed drawings of joining techniques, and the reader quickly realizes that the craftsmanship and careful execution of these joints is the secret to this respected building trade. Flipping through these pages also immediately reveals the compromises that are made in modern home construction. Those who have ever wondered where the term ""stick built"" comes from will find the answer in this book. Dimensional lumber are sticks in comparison to timbers. Though metal connectors used in today's framing have done wonders for total structural stability, this book shows you that timber framing negates the need for stamped steel reinforcement.Timber framed structures are built for permanence, preserving the strength of the frame by encasing it completely within the outer sheathing and exploiting the timbers as an aesthetic interior design element. It is amazing that so many barns and houses were built only by hand, because a single timber required two or more men to lift and transport. In this age, a crane is more appropriate. One should keep this in mind if considering this project on his or her own.The captions in the book are terse and straight forward. ""Wood never lies to you."" ""You don't just hack away obliviously."" As said before, the writing is eloquent, and one can feel the earnestness of the writer with every paragraph. This excerpt sounds like it was written this year, rather than 1980:""To insulate as well as we can and to make houses as tight as we can present new challenges to the building industry. Houses will no longer naturally ventilate because of our inability to get them tight. We can lock them up like thermos bottles if we like. To bring new air into the house, we'll have to design ventilation systems into the plans. With heat loss cut to the bones, we'll have to design natural and mechanical recirculation to keep the temperature even and the air fresh. In this kind of environment, the heat from appliances, lights, and even body heat will contribute significant proportions to the small heating requirements. In houses built this way, energy from the sun, wind, or water could easily replace fuel-fired power sources.""""Energy conservation is the hope of the future. In conscience, we must mark the end of the era of substandard housing that is cheap to build but expensive and wasteful to maintain. In conscience, we should begin a time when houses contain energy-autonomous environments that consume no fossil fuels and are build to last centuries.""Those words are nearly three decades old. They are describing what is sometimes called a ""passivhaus"" or ""passive house"", which is also an established building technique but is only recently seeing revival as a ""green"" building technique. Insulation, rather than expensive heating and cooling systems, is the key to energy efficiency. What the authors are showing is that with a timber frame, the outer skin can be insulated panels that are tightly sealed, making a water tight and nearly air tight structure that is stronger, more permanent, and more energy efficient than any home constructed from dimensional lumber.And if there is any gripe of the book, it is that there should be more detail on the outer sheathing and insulating techniques, as well as wiring methods. There are a few cross sections (fairly detailed) but they are not as comprehensive as other sections of the book. Perhaps in 1980 the insulated panel industry was not large enough to devote more than a few pages to it. But now, there are composite, structurally insulated panels of many varying types that can be used in conjunction with a timber frame to build a very efficient, very strong, and architecturally pleasing home. And this is yet another example of how things come full circle; one of the oldest building techniques proves itself to be superior to its modern replacement in multiple ways.On a personal note my building experience comes from the construction of a stick built garage which, at the time, seemed incredibly stout to me. I used 2x6 lumber for the walls rather than 2x4s, and sheathed the walls and roof with 5/8"" oriented strand board. I used metal connectors in liberal amounts, reinforced the joints and ceiling joists, and insulated the entire structure so that I could work during the cold months. The garage is a solid, well insulated structure that maintains a comfortable climate by insulation and thermal mass alone. I was striving for a better way of building, and after reading this book I see that my desire was for timber frame construction. I wish I would have known more about it when I undertook the garage project, but now if I ever build my own home, I know how I will build it.Lastly, the appendix has diagrams for beam loads that is nearly more comprehensive than some textbooks on the topic of strength of materials. Even if you do not intend to build a home this way, this book may still be of value to you if you have any interest in building, construction, or architecture.For more information on finishing a timber frame home with different structural insulated panel technologies, see Benson's newer book: The Timber-Frame Home: Design Construction Finishing. It has more color photos and addresses the special considerations for foundations, plumbing, wiring, and insulating timber frame homes."	R

"The ancient constitution and the feudal law	"The ancient constitution and the feudal law,: A study of English historical thought in the seventeenth century",,A2UIXU97JYCPZG,R. Albin,6/6,4.0,1259193600,Interesting,"An interesting early book by the great historian of ideas JGA Pocock. This book focuses on what Pocock calls the history of historiography in 17th century England. Pocock is concerned mainly with reconstructing how 17th century intellectuals thought about their past. This apparently recondite topic turns to have a number of interesting dimensions. Pocock begins with a surprising and interesting fact, that something prefiguring historical analysis emerged from the study of legal traditions. This occurred first in 16th century France, where the emerging methods of humanist textual criticism were applied to legal traditions. The existence of different legal traditions in France led several scholars to discover the dynamic quality of legal history, the discovery of feudalism, and reconstruction of legal history in the context of a form of social history. In England, where the common law tradition had no competitors, the evolution of knowledge followed a different course. The common lawyers, epitomized by the great Edward Coke, projected the common law and contemporary English political institutions back into an immemorial past as a permanent feature of English life. This treatment of English legal history was entangled in efforts to resist James I assertions of royal power.Subsequent scholars, notably the great antiquarian Henry Spelman, partly inspired by French scholars, subsequently discovered the changing nature of English law, discovered feudal law, and made inferences from legal history to imaginative and insightful reconstructions of medieval English society. Pocock evinces particular symppathy for Spelman's efforts to elucidate non-anachronistic understandings of key terms and concepts, an activity very similar to Pocock's own scholarly goals. Pocock traces the influence of Spelman's discoveries on subsequent scholars and how these reconstructions of English history were entangled in 17th century politics. This book concludes with a nice chaper on the treatment of English history following the Glorious Revolution, describing the emergence of the Whig version of English history and looking forward to the work of important 18th century historians like Robertson and Hume.Like of all of Pocock's work, this book is characterized by close analysis of the texts, Pocock's impressive erudition, and clear writing."

Newman ""Bob Newman""",9/9,5.0,953510400,Tales of the world I never knew and never will,"Thanks to my grandparents, who came to America in the first decade of the 20th century, I grew up and have had a good life. Thanks to my grandparents, I didn't become a piece of ash or a few tossed out bones in an Eastern European field at the age of 2. Wars are wars; they've occured throughout human history, but in most of them, whole civilizations didn't disappear. But the Eastern European Jewish world is gone forever. I might belong to the same gene pool, but compared to the characters in Isaac Bashevis Singer's stories, I'm as American as apple pie. Irish-Americans can discover their roots in Ireland, Chinese-Americans in China, and so on, but not me. My cultural roots are gone forever. The only way I can learn them is through reading literature written by Singer, Shalom Aleichem, Isaac Babel and others who describe that vanished world. So, obviously, my interest and pleasure in reading such wonderful tales as appear in THE SEANCE and OTHER STORIES is all the more. Never mind my personal reasons. These amazing stories, by a Nobel Prize winner, will stay with you for a long time. The strange, sad characters afflicted by poverty and by life, bring us face to face with common human personalities of all times and places, while also depicting the conditions and peculiar relationships of Jews in Poland too. Magic, religion, animals, thieves, rabbis, prostitutes, mystics, Holocaust survivors, Talmudic scholars, prisoners, books, butchers and shopkeepers crowd the pages. In each story, you find pathos and tragedy, happiness and satisfaction, tensions and transformations. Two of the stories, ""The Seance"" and ""The Letter Writer"" must rank with the best stories I have ever read; none of the others are bad. If you have never read Singer, this is an excellent book to start with. If you have, you know what I am talking about. This is the great writer at the top of his form."	R

The various collections in the end also earned him a very well deserved Nobel Prize for literature in 1978. Several of his stories were first published in magazines like The New Yorker, Encounter and Playboy. The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories, which immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later I have read several of his novels and short stories, where especially the collections Gimpel the Fool, Short Friday and The Seance are at least as good as Passions. All a magnificent world of Isaac Bashevis Singer's saints and sinners. Sad, funny, ironic, poignant and seeming to come from Singer's pen without any efforts.

Singer wrote primarily in Yiddish, and the 16 short stories here have been translated into English by various translators, though overseen by the author.Singer's stories are invariably set among Jewish communities, the majority in the Polish Jewish villages of the late Russian Empire, though three are set in the postwar United States. Readers of this collection should have a basic knowledge of Jewish customs, for example, what a mezzuzah is. Still, behind the trappings of culture, the characters are universal and anyone will recognize themselves and their acquaintances here. At times, however, Singer is more interested in allegory than realism, and the characters represent the Jewish people. Singer's depiction of Polish Jewish life is not a nostalgic reminisce of some purer age, and the frankness of Singer's themes is remarkable. The subject of ""Yanda"" is a provincial prostitute, while ""Zeitl and Rickel"" describes the doomed lesbian romance of two pious girls.Found by chance in a ""take a book, leave a book"" pile, THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES was my introduction to this Nobel laureate. While I'm not so bowled over by the stories to want to seek out other works by this author, the material is consistently entertaining (the 200 pages are a quick read) and some of the endings memorable."

"Open marriage;: A new life style for couples	"Open marriage;: A new life style for couples,",,A1IMB8FTTTJN12,parnassus2,16/18,5.0,1162425600,"title refers to open communication and self examination, not swinging","Please don't be confused by the unfortunate choice of title, nor by the ridiculous books promoting promiscuity that are associated with it by Amazon databases.Let's examine the two negative reviews of this book.One reviewer admits that he had decided the book wasn't worthwhile before reading it, and proceeds with an attitude that dares the authors to change his mind. This is hardly an ""open"" reading, is it? Further, the message of this book is in no way negated by a supposed divorce between the authors. The authors of Open Marriage specifically instruct readers to examine their expectation that marriage lasts forever.Another reviewer has a vested interest in dismissing Open Marriage, because its ideas contradict those of a book he wrote. He is careful to advertise his own book in his negative review of Open Marriage.As for whether Open Marriage is outdated, since when did such things as communication and trust become outdated? With extremes of ideology and dogma on a rapid increase, a book that promotes careful examination of our assumptions and expectations before getting married has never been more relevant. Has Socrates' dictum ""An unexamined life is not worth living"" ever gone out of date?Briefly, I'll quote from chapter 4:""The guidelines [to healthy relationships] are as follows:1 realistic expectations2 privacy3 open and honest communication4 flexibility in roles5 open companionship6 equality7 identity8 trustWhere do love, sex, and fidelity fit in? Are these not guidelines too - the basic components of any marriage? Important, yes; guidelines, no. Many of the problems with the closed marriage [defined by poor communication, lack of trust, immaturity etc.] stem from a false concept of the part that love, sex, and fidelity play in the relationship between man and a woman. The guidelines of open marriage listed above form the basis upon which love, sex, and fidelity achieve their meaning, not vice versa. If personal identity is based on love, equality measured by sex, and trust defined by fidelity, then identity will be crushed by a lessening of the initial romantic fervor, equality diminished by a temporary failure in sex, and trust destroyed through even the appearance of infidelity. But if personal identity, equality and trust exist in full measure, then the normal fluctuations that occur in any relationship between two human beings can be taken in stride.""One way of looking at the book Open Marriage is to say that the authors are discussing which comes first, the chicken or the egg? They are revealing that love, sex, and fidelity are outcomes of mature relating, thus not the cause of mature relating. If we reverse causation and pursue the product directly, without the process, than we set in motion a degradation from expectation, to demands, to manipulation, to frustration, and ending in ""bitter disappointment"" (chapter 4). For example, suspicious jealousy pursues fidelity directly, bypassing the process of building trust and commitment. On the other hand, when we follow the above 8 principles of healthy relating, the likely outcome is love, and fidelity. I recall a TV Sitcom in which a holiday family reunion wasn't going well, and someone angrily threatened that ""we all had better start having fun right now!"" Again, pursuit of the outcome directly without the process, results in our realizing the very thing we most fear (can you hear echoes of Dr. Phil McGraw in this?)The authors are saying that an unexamined marriage will fail because our unconscious assumptions, demands, and expectations are going to take over, and a great deal of negative conflict will result. These authors are simply saying that we need to pay attention and be proactive, examine our thoughts and feelings openly, and negotiate a mutually acceptable relationship. This open communication and cooperation, as opposed to conflict, is what the authors refer to in the title of their book. They are referring to a Socratic openness to challenging one`s own thoughts and behaviors as a basis of healthy living. This point is strongly supported by Dr. M. Scott Peck, author of The Road Less Traveled, who refers to Open Marriage on page 93 of ...Traveled. Dr. Peck's says the same thing with a different metaphor: we ought to examine our mental ""maps"" and be willing to revise them to keep ourselves dedicated to reality. Let Dr. Peck's reference carry more weight than mine."	R

By this logic, is monogamy null and void, because monogamous people divorce? No type of relationship--straight, gay, monogamous, polyamorous, etc--is guaranteed against breakup. There are also horrendous relationships that are together forever because of desperation or beliefs. Even if there is a higher percentage of breakup in a certain relationship style, is ""together until death"" the only measure of a valid relationship?As many people pointed out, ""open marriage"" back then didn't mean specifically what it does now. In this book it means communicating openly, treating each other as equals, and allowing each other personal freedom. Most of this book is about how to get along better in a relationship by remembering that you both are individuals. You don't have to do everything together or have everything in common. You don't have to give up separate interests that your partner doesn't share. You don't have to give up friends when you get married. Giving up things like that don't make couples closer; they make couples resent each other and also take away their outside support systems.They mention non-monogamy as a possibility if both partners agree to it. They mention that depending on the context, sex with another person may not be the most horrible betrayal in a marriage (I said, depending on context. There are plenty of times it is a major betrayal.) Specifically I remember the passage about ""the grass is always greener"", and how with no fence, there is less of that feeling.My criticism of the ""love and sex without jealousy"" chapter is they talk about not having jealousy, but aren't very specific about how to deal with it and how to overcome it. (There are other books on open relationships that go into more detail about that.)Another criticism is that at times it relies on a premise of both people having careers that allow for economic independence. A career like that is not available to all people; there is no reason that only people with good careers should be able to have good relationships.There are lots of self-help books that promise a ""one and only way"" to have a satisfying relationship if you follow some off-the-wall advice, including the ""emotional infidelity"" variety that do advise couples to avoid friends and spend all of their time together. This book, in comparison, is common sense. Whether you want to be monogamous or non-monogamous, I think this book provides practical advice that should be elementary, but often isn't."	R

The Ground and Grammar of Theology	The Ground and Grammar of Theology,,A1KM9L3MAZ4RBF,Mr. S. E. Johnson,9/11,5.0,1203120000,A step in the right direction!,"This is ground breaking work. It moves away from the abstract, dualistic ideas of God that are grounded in Greek philosophical and pagan concepts. T. F. Torrance describes in detail where these ideas originated from and how they often threatened the integrity of the gospel. The churches in the first few hundred years were forever challenged with concepts and ideas that had no grounding in Scripture and tradition. By contrasting Jesus Christ as the centre for all our understanding about who God is and what God does against false concepts, Torrance very effectively shows how the church today has lost this vital focus. I would consider this book to be a masterpiece in bringing the cosmic reality of the gospel in the person and work Jesus Christ to a shocking and utterly staggering degree.

"Mary	"Mary, Mary",,A1RIAF5QEF3NRN,erika,3/4,2.0,974592000,Never gets going,"This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written."	R
"Mary	"Mary, Mary",,,,2/4,1.0,1071964800,"Fissure a mile-wide in this thin, confusing novel.","Early on in this story reader is informed that main character has a split personality. 3 girls are murdered and buried in back yard of Mary Barton, protagonist. Mary B. is sweet and loves her garden. Her other half is wicked to the max. The novel starts with her cussing like a sailor, wholly unlike sweet Mary B. The incredibly stupid atty. doesn't infer anything about the seeming two Mary's. Mary B. charged with murder that she obviously committed. Most of book contains court scenes that are well-written but are merely banal and static, the story stops. After conviction inevitable knife attack on atty by bad Mary, who we now learn is a twin of good Mary; at least that's the way the book reads. Within the reality of the book this is impossible and nonsense. But the reader is supposed to believe that good Mary has an evil twin who did the killings...I read the ending of the novel several times to see if it was communicating to the reader that the bad Mary was just the evil side of Mary B., i.e. she has a split personality. But, no, the book is saying that there are two Maries...not one with a good and bad side. If you want to read a lot of fairly interesting courtroom questioning by prosecutor and def. atty, most of the book is irrelevantly devoted to this, so read it and enjoy an O.J. moment. Perhaps the worst mystery/suspense novel I have ever read. This is my fourth and last McBain novel. HIs stories read at supersonic speed and purposefully divert the reader from thinking about the plot, characters, conflict,etc. Recommended solely for no-depth crowd of mystery readers (90% of readers are in this category; hence, the popularity ofjames patterson, Sue Grafton, Kellerman's,and many more; can anyone actually read Elizabeth George's prose and not become constipated and nauseous). Also, irrelevant romance between Mary's defense atty and female prosecutor. Added nothing to story, except perhaps to be a lame red herring that the femme fatale might have something to do with the murders."	R

Trouble on Titan	Trouble on Titan,,,,9/9,4.0,925344000,This was an intriguing book that influenced my destiny.,"I read &quot;Trouble on Titan&quot; around 1970, when the Apollo program was at its apex, and the human exploration of the Solar System seemed only a short step away. My review is based on old memories, but I can still remember a mining colony on Titan and jet craft using oxygen for fuel and burning Titan's methane atmosphere. We've learned much since this book was written, and Titan's atmosphere has less methane than we originally thought. However, this book was well written, and I am sure will intrigue my son as much as it intrigued his father, who is now working at NASA on the Cassini/Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan. This book has that old-style sci-fi flavor that made another world seem more like reality than fantasy.

Communicating with Orcas - The Whales' Perspective	Communicating with Orcas - The Whales' Perspective,4.30,A33LNJBNL8KCU6,Paul Nelson,12/13,4.0,1042848000,Orca Wisdom as told by Mary Getten,"Whales in the dreams of children, whale spirituality, whale sex and whale governance are all things we'll not likely get from scientific researchers for decades, perhaps a century or two. That is one reason the new book by Mary Getten, a Naturalist specializing in the wildlife of the San Juan Islands and a practicing animal communicator is so brilliant. This is not for folks who think that actual communication with whales (or other critters) is impossible. Those folks are probably the same people who get angry at their dogs for not doing what they are told.Mary herself was once a skeptic, as she relates in ""Communicating with Orcas: The Whales' Perspective"". At her first animal communication workshop, facilitated by Penelope Smith, Mary was given the task to communicate with Pirouette, Penelope's cockatiel:""I knew nothing about birds. Mammals were my passion, and I had nointerest in delicate little avians. Truthfully, I was a little frightened of them, yet here I was face to face with a cockatiel and it was time for us to talk.I looked into her bright white face, admiring the crest of yellow feathers on her forehead and the orange dot on her cheek. Drinking in her features, I relaxed and thought, this won't be too tough. She seems nice enough. So I began to think about what to say to her.This is where it all went downhill. I didn't have a clue what to say to a bird. You would have though that I'd spent my entire life locked into a closet. Not a single question appeared. Time ticked by and I knew I had to so something, so I kept repeating: ""Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette.""Finally, I stopped for a moment to think of something else to say, and clear as a bell I heard Pirouette say: ""Can't you say anything but hello?""Humor, backed with good science and historical tidbits going back to Aristotle and Pliny The Elder balance the presentation for those who are a little reticent to believe in this mode of communication. (This skepticism persists even in the wake of breakthrough research by famed scientist Rupert Sheldrake.) Mary's writing is clear and accessible and the stories of whale sex are quite funny. I mean laugh-out-loud, drool on the PAGE funny.Yet, the skepticism that Mary had when first learning to communicate with animals is the book's biggest weakness, in my view. I was fascinated by the notion of Ruffles, the male elder of the Southern Puget Sound resident community's J Pod, visiting the dreams of schoolchildren who had been on whale-watching cruises. The notion that our species, the lowly Homo sapiens, is at the beginning of a new wave of consciousness that will see remarkable innovations in bodies and senses, or that of the whale councils, the ability to live in past lives (though whales don't call them that) and their description of the universal life force as ""The Prime Cause,"" are all subjects that fascinate me, but the book only teases with these concepts. Perhaps a sequel is called for.However, these are pretty far-out concepts for the average reader and when it comes down to it, Mary has covered the basics in a thorough manner with a wicked wit. If you have the least bit of interest in Orcas, you will be able to read this book in a weekend.May we all be able to live in the moment like these whales have for thousands of years. Their intelligence is much needed in these days when our allegedly more intelligent species, can't get beyond such insanity as war and environmental degradation.Paul Nelson"	R

This book is awesome, entertaining, witty, and written from a totally unique whale's perspective which can not help but captivate you. Communicating with Orcas is skillfully presented to communicate points that Granny wishes to make about the life of whales, her profound observations of the human race, and the essential roll that the whales play in raising the consciousness of the earth. Before reading this book, I would never have entertained the idea that communication with a whale or any other animal for that matter could indeed be possible. One has to be able to accept that things do exist that are not readily proven or explained by Newtonian scientific theories. The insight provided in this book will truly astound you.

Little did I realise I was actually getting a narative about a woman who says she can telepathically communicate with animals.Now, don't get me wrong. I have done research into the telepathic Animal Communication, even as a freshman in college right now I have done more research into it. And even though there seems to be something, I have yet to see a bonified scientific study followed by a scientific peer reviewed paper on these experiences people have. And even as a person going into a minor Psychology I know that Psychological and behavioral studies are very difficult, becuase of the amazing amount of variables that are caused by the extremely complex brain, alone. But even I can not take much of this at face value.I believe her, I don't think she is lying. I question the validity of the actual communication. Is she really linking mentally to this orca, or is this her not fully understanding the duality that many people fall into, and is she thinking that is J2 (or Granny we call her) talking to her?I really want to give her credit and I really wanted to believe her, but I can't. She didn't give me much to really grab onto as a convincing argument for her so called abilities. And she is not the first animal communicator I have done a little research on. There was one woman mentioned in ""Freeing Keiko"" who said that whales and dolphins were essentially extraterrestrial beings that were guiding the earth through space. Another woman said that Greyhound dogs were also extraterrestrial beings.Just the simple fact that there is glaring inconstancies between different animal communicators should be enough evidence that there really isn't too much, if anything, to Telepathic Animal Communication.It was an entertianing book, I rather enjoyed it. But I am a sceptic. And being a sceptic I would be completely honest about my position. If something really seems to make sense, I will say it does. But this book didn't. And saying that, I would not be talking about this book to my friends or family. If it does turn up in conversation, it will most likely be during our psuedopyschological studies.

He then defends the infamous anti-Israeli professors at Columbia University, who in real life substitute racist propaganda for scholarship in the classroom. And he dismisses criticism of this attack on academic standards as the work of right-wing groups, pro-Israeli groups, and donors. Even if some criticism of all this dishonesty were from such groups, that would not invalidate it! He tells us to speak and act before it is too late. I suggest we all do just that, and speak out against him.There are a couple of interesting discussions about the extent to which a professor's ""extracurricular"" work should be protected. My feeling is that it should be. Noam Chomsky is used as an example. I happen to think that Chomsky ought to have a right to tell outright lies as part of his extracurricular activities as long as he does not commit any felonies. Others feel differently about this, and still others feel that even outright academic dishonesty in one's professional work ought to be okay (something I disagree with completely).By the way, speaking of felonies, we do see a reference that Sami al-Arian was ""disciplined for a statement concerning terrorism."" But no mention is made of the enormous amount of evidence that al-Arian had long been a terrorist leader. In fact, that evidence finally got al-Arian fired. Are we now supposed to excuse felons, dismissing their crimes under the mantle of academic freedom? I hope not.Judith Butler repeats the slander that ""any criticism of Israel"" is called anti-Semitic by quite a few folks. And she complains about criticism of the notorious International Solidarity Movement. If she wants to make a case for something, I think she ought to be far more honest. Kathleen Frydl attacks the idea of withholding funding from universities if their expenditures promote ""violence, terrorism, or the destruction of any state."" Now, maybe the wording of such an idea needs some work. But I think it is completely proper to try to stop universities from spending taxpayer money on pro-terrorist propaganda.Amy Newhall is worried about the United States attaching strings to some language programs. But I think she's the problem here. There are programs that the United States government supports to teach, for example, Arabic in universities. The government does so in the hopes that at least a few students in such programs will use their knowledge of the language to work for the government. If the university encourages them not to do so and we wind up without any benefit from those programs, I think there is no reason to continue them: let the universities use their own money to teach Arabic in that case.Perhaps the most vicious article is by Joel Beinin. Beinin seems to attack everyone who opposes the substitution of dishonest propaganda for scholarly work, calling such opposition the work of people he dubs ""the American Likud."" He says ""this is not the first time right-wing fanatics have waged a campaign of vilification, guilt by association, guilt by ethnic or religious affiliation, and delegitimization of dissenting opinions."" And in this regard, he mentions HUAC and Joe McCarthy. But in fact, it is Beinin himself who is doing all this, in the service of right-wing fanatics no less. A special target of Beinin is a particularly praiseworthy organization, Campus Watch. This organization exposes some of the disinformation and incitement we see on campus, but Beinin claims that what it reports is ""false and brazenly bigoted."" It is neither. Once again, Beinin appears to accuse others of what he himself is guilty of.This book pretends to be defending academia. In fact, it is defending academic dishonesty. This dishonesty is a threat to ruin the reputations of plenty of academic departments and possibly discredit entire fields of study. I think we should all encourage the academic community to fight against such violations of academic standards."	R

Campen,0/0,4.0,1272240000,"Pretty good, although a few flaws","This is, all-around, a pretty good lawn book. However, there are a few cases where the advice is a little outdated given the latest research on the subject.One is the subject of using a mulching mower; research has shown that using a mulching mower does not contribute significantly to thatch buildup. Finely chopped grass clippings from lawn grasses decompose very rapidly. I guess you might get in trouble if you have lots of aggressive weed grasses that grow extremely rapidly, leaving much larger amounts of grass clippings. It is also possible that using a non-mulching mower could get you in trouble; it sounds like Mr. Baker might be using a reel mower, which doesn't pulverize the leaves. The research that I have seen studied the effects of using a mulching mower on lawn grass only, so if you have loads of tall weed grasses, or are using a non-mulching mower, you might have trouble.Another is the subject of aeration. From what I have read, spike aeration (Mr. Baker recommends the use of those spike aerator sandal things) is not very effective. Core aeration, which is admittedly more difficult and expensive, is what gets the best results, and is actually effective at controlling thatch.Here is one of the many pages on these subjects:[...]"	R

Everyone left lost a family member, and mourning set upon the community.Needless to say, their lot was not easy, and most ultimately succumbed.This is a valuable testament to horrors suffered in the Holocaust by one community, horrors that were repeated in every other ghetto across Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Poland and so on.Heartbreaking.--Alyssa A.

Her basic education took 5 years to complete. Five years later, she still takes many supplementary courses each year to continue her education. Most of her free time is spend with distance learning courses or reaching herbs. Chinese Medicine is vast and deep. A 5 year basic study is not nearly enough time to understand this medicine. In Chinese Medicine, they say even a lifetime is not long enough to understand this medicine. Thankfully for the lay person we have this book!I personally own 2 copies of this book. One I have at home, the other is in our Chinese Medicine office. Many of our patients have purchased their own copy of this book after reading our office copy.The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine is the best book that I have read to understand what my partner practices. I have read other books, likeThe Web That Has No Weaver : Understanding Chinese MedicineandBetween Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine, although highly recommended, these 2 books are much more technical and can be overwhelming at times (especially The Web 2nd edition). After reading The Complete Illustrated Guide, if you want to learn more then these other two books are worth a read. Far and away the best dietary book on Chinese Medicine is Bob Flaw'sThe Tao of Healthy Eating: Dietary Wisdom According to Traditional Chinese Medicine. Also,The Book of Jook: Chinese Medicinal Porridges--A Healthy Alternative to the Typical Western Breakfastby Bob Flaws is a good helpful for breakfast food and as a total diet longevity practice (similar to Kitchari in Ayurveda).The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine provides a complete overview of all of the modalities included under the largre umbrella of Chinese Medicine. You'll learn about the medicine theory, diagnosis, energetic ""anatomy"", acupuncture, herbal medicine, diet, exercise, qi gong, tai chi, meditation, and lifestyle theory.The section on diet is lacking, in my opinion, however the author does state that information on diet could fill an entire book itself - which is definitely true. ReadThe Tao of Healthy Eating: Dietary Wisdom According to Traditional Chinese Medicinefor proper Chinese Medicine dietary knowledge.The sections on Qi Gong and Tai Chi are great for a general book. You'll be taught a basic sequence in each. For additional learning, Mantak Chia's books and DVDs are some of the most complete spiritual-style Qi Gong practices practices. Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming has created some of the best martial arts style Qi Gong and Tai Chi books and DVDs.The theory and science sections make up the majority of this book, providing an excellent introduction with much knowledge and no fluff. Someone interesting in attending TCM school would greatly benefit by reading this book first. You'll understand what TCM is and have good preparation for the conceptual basis of Chinese Medicine.The entire book is filled with pictures to support the information. A picture is worth 1,000 words and many times it is only through pictures that proper understanding can be attained (like meridians, tongue diagnosis, etc). The book is very well organized with section titles and concise paragraphs with subtitles. It is clear that the authors spent much time and calculation to create this book.Personally, I can't think of anything missing from this book. Although I would have liked to see another 2-4 pages on dietary theory and practice, it is not strong enough of a complaint to remove a star from my rating. This book is 5 stars all the way!Additional note:It is important to remember that Chinese Medicine is a medicine and should only be practiced by a trained professional. There is a lot that a person can do to improve health and grow spiritually without the help of a Chinese Medicine practitioner/doctor - like diet, exercise, meditation, qi gong, yoga, etc. However when it comes to deeper knowledge and practices like Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine, these are best left to the professionals. My partner is a professional Chinese Medicine Acupuncturist and Herbalist. It is common that people come into her office who are worse off after having self-treated using herbal knowledge from books, magazines, and newscasts. Taking herbs for symptom relief is not anywhere close to the Chinese Medicine herbal understanding. If you are suffering from health problems, please see a professional.After it's complete, an education in Chinese Medicine is a 5 year Ph.D. program (including both Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine). This is an entire year longer than Western Medicine. This is not to say that Chinese Medicine is superior, but rather that both studies are long and difficult. Chinese Medicine should not be looked at to be inferior to modern Western medicine. Rather both are complete forms of medicine and require much more understanding than can be gained by a single text book.The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine is the best place to start to better understand what Chinese Medicine is and how you can live a healthier and happier life.Was my review helpful?

Cox's argument was that urbanization and secularization go together, and that they empty the world of mythic and traditional religious power.Today forty years after the publication of his book the world is in the midst of a global struggle in which the forces of Western democratic society are pitted against a radical Islamic revivalist fundamentalism. Moreover within the realms of other religions including Christianity there has been a kind of 'return to religion' which was certainly not dreamnt of in Cox analysis. He did not have a clue in regard to the Evangelical revival in the United States, and the prominent place it would come to play, ( Perhaps unprecedented place) in American politics.This does not make Cox's analysis wrong for his time. Nor was he mistaken in seeing the important trend to secularization. He only made the mistake most of us make of seeing the past and future of what seemed to him the predominant and irreversible trend of his time.But History and the development of Mankind have a way of surprising us all.As a footnote I would say that the one area of the world in which Cox analysis does seem to be largely correct today is Europe. 'Post-Christian Europe' however does not seem the apogee of human enlightentment , the wave of the future. Rather it seems more a declining island already invaded by those kind of 'religious forces it expelled as Christian and is receiving as Muslim'.Irony of ironies, that the very heart of the 'secular city' today seems as if it will in a matter of generations take a great fall into backwardness. But again this is an aside, and I would instead make the more general caveat, that no one should fall so readily into the underlying assumption of Cox's analysis i.e. that there is a predominant historical trend for the future which we can clearly discern.Wisdom and humility would suggest that we rely more on our powers of future observation than of extrapolation from the Past."

0671551345	Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,1/3,5.0,1043971200,one of the best night world books!!!!,first of all i thought that this was one of lj smith's best books she has written adn also the funniest. i love all the characters but my fave one in the book is Ash. he's really a hottie and a babe i just love him 4 trying 2 be real. so far ash and thierry are my 2 most fave male characters in the night world series. anyways this book is about 3 sisters who are fugitives from the night world trying to live normal lives with humans but finding out that theyre brother Ash wants them back home. and meets up with mary- lynnette who turns out to be his soulmate but doesnt want it as much as she doesnt want it either. anyways i thought Ash was a much better character in daughters of darkness than in secret vampire i thought he acted like a jerk in the 1st night wortld book. it tells me that he has gotten better and that not all humans are bad to live by. i would love to have a guy like Ash for a bf. he's a total babe. funny 2. well g2g also if anyone is waiting for strange fate 2 come out it wont be coming out til 2004.

Night World: Daughters Of Darkness	Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,A1V0SFB3AXM8JK,"K. Davis ""The Rose Bride""",0/2,1.0,1177718400,Disappointing to say the least,"This book is probably, in my opinion, one of (if not THE) worst in the Night World Series. It is Ash's story this time, who's soulmate just happens to be a human. (which Ironically was shadowed upon in the first book, 'Secret Vampire'.) Ash's character was cool, charismatic....and totally wasted in this book. Mary Lynnette was too self riteous, too...I don't know. To me, she didn't come off as the strong female lead she was supposed to. Instead, I found myself annoyed at her several times throughout the book. She was presumptuous, she was always assuming things, and she was rather stereotypic if you ask me. I think someone like Maggy from 'Black Dawn', or even someone like Hanna or Gillian from 'Soulmate' and 'Dark Angel' would have been a better match for Ash, not this smart alec, holier than thou woman named Mary Lynnette.The book itself was lacking as well. We pretty much learn nothing about the nightworld, it doesn't much progress the series except to mention a few characters that appear in future books. All in all, a disappointment. Ash's first appearance in 'Secret Vampire' stole the show, so when this book was released, I was ecstatic. 'Finally', I thought. 'Something that touches on Ash's past and personality. We will finally get to read his story.' Well, as it turned out, he was poorly underwritten. Or perhaps this particular book would have worked better if it had been a little later in the series, if Mary Lynnette wasn't so sharp tongued, if there weren't so many CHARACTERS to concentrate on. This wasn't so much Ash and M.L's story as it was all the sisters. Too many people to concentrate on. The three sisters should have been given their own book for character developement if that was the case. I would suggest this book only to those who wish to further their Night World series collection, or just their L.J Smith collection, in general. As for the enjoyment factor?...Nadda."	R

Night World: Daughters Of Darkness	Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,0/0,5.0,884476800,The Best of the Night World,"Though the plot is much like that of Pride and Prejudice, this book has a real feeling and flow that the rest of the Night World books can't compare with. There is a depth of character in both Mary-Lynnette, Ash, his sisters and Mark that L.J. Smith can usually only spin in the three books of her earlier trilogies. The departure of Ash at the end of the book has left me, now more than a year later, still anticipating his return, and the furthering of the relationship between him and Mary-Lynnette. The characters seemed more down-to-earth and more easy to identify with, as the author didn't go into the somewhat fascinating but still pointless and shallow descriptions of every physical characteristic of the characters. Mary-Lynnette seemed a truly real girl, with dreams of her career in astronomy and her share of problems. Ash, although made a spectacle of with his good looks in the first novel of the Night World, was intelligent and portrayed well. I wish that Ms. Smith had chosen to chronicle this book into an entire trilogy as she has in the past; I would have found Mary-Lynnette and Ash even more enthralling if we had seen their development over the course of a longer period."

Before I discovered these books I never read anything due to sheer boredom. Now I feel that these books have helped me immensly! Anyway, I really should get on to my comments concerning the book. Daughters Of Darkness is really one of the best Night World books of all. It is sweet, suspenseful, and well written all in one great package. Unfortunetly, though these book literally melt my heart, I am afriad I will never find a man worthy of my all time favorate L.J. Smith badboys such as Ash(Daughters of Darkness), Gabriel(mmm.. oh! um Dark Visions), Nick(Secret Circle), and Quinn(short but sweet... from The Chosen). Oh well!! Anyhow read the books, people!!

I'm still waiting for Black Dawn to come out. Mary-Lynnette and Ash are so realistic, besides that he's a vampire. My favorite part is when Mare keeps kicking him in the shins. It's funny, because it also tells us (this is what I interpreted) that it doesn't matter what race you are, it matters whats on the inside. Afterall, like Jade says, &quot;You can't be soulmates with vermin!&quot"	R
Night World: Daughters Of Darkness	Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,3/4,5.0,1047600000,Second Book in the Night World Series,"Set in Briar Creek, Oregon, ""Daughters of Darkness"" primarily follows 17-year-old Mary-Lynnette Carter, though the book is supposedly about her new neighbors, three vampire sisters: Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade Redfern. The book does start off that way, following these three runaways on their way to their aunt's house. There they discover that their aunt has been killed--staked through the heart by a possible vampire hunter who wants to punish them for breaking the laws of the Night World, which all vampires, werewolves, and witches must abide by in this series. In an attempt to cover their tracks, the sisters bury the old woman in their backyard, but Mary-Lynnette sees them doing this--and again, later on, in the company of her younger brother, Mark, when they transfer the body into the woods.To make a long story short, Mary-Lynnette and Mark are befriended by these vampires in a blood-tie ceremony and promise to help find the killer running loose in Briar Creek. Like all of L. J. Smith's books, there's an added bit of romance to the paranormal/horror base of the story, for both Mary-Lynnette and Mark. (They meet their respective soulmates: Ash and Jade.) Even though I haven't read any of the other books in this series and can't compare this one to the others, I really liked ""Daughters of Darkness."" It was fast-paced, well-written, and ideal for teens who are into paranormal romances."	R
Night World: Daughters Of Darkness	Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,7/10,5.0,943401600,This book had me giggling,"I'm sorry, but I just find the way Mary Lennette treats Ash to be just hillarious. Mary Lennette is like a Nancy Drew. Ok, actually I never liked the Nancy Drew series and never read them, but the book kind of starts out with a mystery like that. She's just a character who if Iknew her in person, I'd probably like her. She's smart, and stands pretty much up for what she believes in and really does care for people. She's just totally not the person I could ever picture Ash with. I still can giggle at that part where she realizes he can see more in the dark and without thinking just shines the flashlight into his eyes. She discovers horribly diliated pupils, and Ash is just screaming out in pain. Then, right after that she asks him to tell her how many stars he can see, and he's just like &quot;None. I'm blind!&quot; I don't know, maybe the way I said it isn't that funny, but I thought it was hillarious. Ash is hillarious with his little side comments and he's simply a very interesting character. It took me awhile to get myself to finally buy it, but its definetly a good read."	R

She's a human obsessed with astromomy who's stumbled across a strange, supernatural secret about the new girls next door. Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade are beautiful vampire sisters who have escaped from their strict home across the country. Mary Lynette and her brother, Mark, become quick friends with the sisters, but someone doesn't want them to live in harmony.And then there's the slight problem that the girls' brother, Ash (who appeared in the first Night World book, Secret Vampire), who has come to bring his sisters back. Ash is icy cold and ruthless, but Mary Lynette might just be the person to melt his heart.This book is so awesome that you won't want to put it down until you've finished. But I would definitely recommend reading the Night World series in order, since the characters reappear and the events link together, so if you haven't read Secret Vampire yet, do that first. But if you have, definitely read this book!"	R
Night World: Daughters Of Darkness	Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,2/3,5.0,905644800,THIS IS MY FAV BOOK IN THE SERIES!!!!,"This is the best book out of the Night World series. At first, in the first book, u think Ash is the bad guy, but that opinion totally goes out the window when u read this book.(The same thing w/ Quinn, but that's another book) I have all the Night World books and love them all. I've read them all over and over, but this is my fav. I can totally relate w/ the feeling of longing Mary-Lynette felt at the beginning, and like her, I am looking for someone to share the night w/ (even though i know only a little about astronomy) Ash is definantly a character. He's strong-willed, and has a smart mouth, but is vulnerable like a hurt child underneath it all. There needs to be another book that continues the story of Ash, Mary-Lynette, Mark and the sisters. Ash had small parts in Dark Angel (when he got Gillian out of that club Angel lured her in) and in Soulmates (when he was in Circle Daybreak when he met Hannah and told her about his soulmate.) If you haven't read this one yet, it is a must read. I beleive in soulmates and it makes me wish for mine even more If only the Night World really existed . . . but oh well.

Night World: Daughters Of Darkness	Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,A3CLKX8W3F1L1D,Werther Bentine Torres,0/0,3.0,1276560000,Quick and Fun,"As an adult reader I gave this a 3 star because some things were not very logical. The story was well written and as a teen I think I would have given it a 4 maybe even a 5. I would not mind letting my children read this book as the love relationships are based on emotions rather than physical appearance and pleasure. The relationship between the characters are healthy, for example they do not have the male stalking the female or the female saying she is going to die without the male. Yes that is a comparison to the Twilight series, but this series was written long before Twilight was thought of.The parts I did not find logical is the fact the vampire girls were not going to use any of the powers in the new town they moved too. Why not? I get that they did not want to kill their food (people) but why not talk to each other telepathically. What is the point of not doing that? No one would have known they were doing that. Vampires are stronger than people and one girl had a hard time doing a task a human could do without a problem. Another thing that bothered me about this book is Poppy and James are not in this book. There was a thought of them for a second but I would have liked something to let me know how they were doing. Is Poppy still an illegal vampire? Did her dad except them and her living dead situation? I mean so many unanswered questions."	R
Night World: Daughters Of Darkness	Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,A2KBHSK5BS35BH,Leeanna Chetsko,0/0,1.0,1260662400,Night World 2: Daughters of Darkness,"Night World #2: Daughters of Darkness, by L. J. SmithFor me, ""Daughters of Darkness"" is the one sour note in Smith's Night World series. It was the one book in the nine book series that I had to force myself to finish (I am obsessive about finishing everything I read).The concept is interesting, but I feel it could have used better execution. As with all Night World books, the protagonist is female. Mary-Lynette is a human and unaware of the secret world of vampires, werewolves, and other spooky things that exist around her. She thinks she lives in the quietest, most boring town in the world, but that's all about to change when a series of startling events happens.When the next door neighbor goes missing just as her three nieces arrive in town, and Mary-Lynette sees them burying something in the backyard, she's immediately suspicious. Unable to leave the mystery alone, she heads next door and meets the new arrivals, who further her apprehension about the disappearance of her neighbor. The girls remind her of predators, which is unsurprising as the girls are lamia, or born vampires.The mystery of who killed the neighbor takes up a good chunk of the book, and in my opinion, is very over used. It just drags on too long, and every time there was a new twist in the whodunit, I kept thinking, ""Okay, that's the end of it now...no, wait...there's more. Sigh.""Ash Redfern also makes an appearance in this book (some readers may remember him from ""Night World #1: Secret Vampire,"" where he waylaid Poppy), and is a starring character along with his sisters. Initially he's on the hunt for the three sisters, who ran away from a vampire enclave. Ash is characterized as the ultimate vampire - humans are vermin and nothing more, to him. Mary-Lynette takes an immediate dislike to him when meeting him for the first time. And here's where the potentially interesting concept comes in - Ash and Mary-Lynette are soulmates, but unlike Smith's other couples, the two can't stand each other.But something about this book just didn't do it for me. Maybe it was the overly drawn out murder mystery. Or maybe it was that the main character, Mary-Lynette, seemed dry. Or maybe even what seemed interesting - soulmates disliking each other - somehow doesn't fit in a series that's about finding your soulmate.1/5."	R

The tale had a bit less... urgency... than its predecessor, and while I did like the redemption of Ash, bad-boy blonde from the first novel, the character development was again a little underexplored. But the world-building is pleasant and well-done, without info-dumping on young readers with potentially short attention spans.Again I can't help but wonder what a greater length could have done for the series -- ""Daughters' ""plot is a bit simplistic.

Night World: Daughters Of Darkness	Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,A38EDDASAM1W0V,M. Cookson,2/2,5.0,1022976000,best of the Night World books,"Jade, Kestrel, and Rowan, three vampire sisters, have left their home in secrecy. Tired of living in a society that acts as though it's stuck in the 16th century, they decided to go live with their great-aunt. Unfortunately, she's been staked, and they have no idea who did it. Things are further complicated when Ash, their brother, comes to take them back. Ash gets something of a shock, however - he finds his soulmate in the small town of Briar Creek, and she's human.If you've read the first Night world book, you'll remember Ash. Believe it or not, he gets even better in this book. It's hilarious watching the usually confident Ash try to figure out how to deal with the reality of having a human soulmate (one who kicks him at every opportunity). This book is different from all the other Night World books, in that the soulmates here do not like each other and would like to find a way not to have that bond. I consider Ash to be one of the more complex characters in the series, and this book peels away a lot of the layers. Mary-Lynnette, his soulmate, is great, because she doesn't just let Ash walk all over her - she talks back, and, like I said, she kicks him a lot. The mystery element of the book is pretty interesting, and I liked the three sisters, although the author doesn't really go into as much depth with their characters as you might think she does from what the back of the book says. This book is less about the sisters and more about the murder, Ash, and Mary-Lynnette."	R

Mary-Lynette and the rest of the characters are well thought-out also, and I hope to read about them in the future. This is my favorite series of L.J. Smith's, because in incorporates all creatures of the night. I look forward to reading Huntress and Black Dawn, since I've read all the other Night World books numerous times already, to indulge my fantasy craving mind. My only disappointment is that there are no shapeshifter soulmates. They must be just as intriguing as witches and vampires. And why can't I find Volume one of the Vampire Diaries anywhere?

Fisher ""Raye""",4/5,3.0,1019001600,"Murder, mystery, werewolves, vampire and soulmates","Daughters of Darkness is the second book in the Night World series and centres around three groups of people - Mark and Mary Lynette Carter, two siblings who are wannabe astronomers, Rowan, Kestral and Jade Redfern, three vampire sisters escaping the confining life their previous home the vampire conclave, and Ash Redfern, their elder brother who's come to drag them home and successfully has L.J. Smith fans swooning in the aisles.It is an interesting premise, and things start to heat up when the girls arrive at their great-aunt Opal Burdock's house in Briar Creek only to find her staked through the heart. Panicking, they bury the body in the garden outside, but are witnessed by Mary-Lynette who's watching the stars on the hill overlooking the house. Doubtful that Mrs Burdock is really dead, Mary-Lynette and her brother nevertheless investigate, and come across the vampire sisters hunting in the wood...However, because Mark and Jade fall pretty fast for each other a truce is made and the sisters share their fears with the two siblings - something is out there, something that's killing things, and all of them work their dectective skills to figure out who it is ... Ash? Bunny Marten, the shop attendant with the lamia name? Jeremy, the garage worker with a deep, dark secret? A vampire hunter?And then Ash turns up, and to his and Mary-Lynette's horror, they find they are soulmates, destined to be together even though Ash is not a very nice guy.The story is pretty interesting, and it's fun to guess whodunnit, though I admit I was a *little* disappointed as to the murderer's motives. L.J. Smith obviously had fun designing the three sisters, all with different personalities and features. For once there wasn't a contrived happy ending that is so popular in L.J. Smith's books, and the atmosphere of the book was very well done too - the desert-like Briar Creek gave a sense of being trapped in the middle of nowhere with a wild beast on the loose, and chemistry between all the characters was realistic, poignent, and sometimes funny. (Watch out for Ash giving Jeremy a hard time).All in all, this was a much better book than the first 'Secret Vampire', which extented the Night World a bit, and mingled together characters that have been in previous books (Ash) and characters who'll appear in future ones (Quinn)."

Relatives of James from the first book, we meet Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade. They are three vampire sisters who snuck away from home. Tired of the secret society, they want to try to live as humans out in Oregon. They move into a dilapidated old home, next to Mark and Mary-Lynette Carter. As Jade and Mark get closer, their brother Ash comes to town to bring his sisters back. Of course, he meets Mary-Lynette and things get interesting...Ash, the handsome blondie who we remember from the first book as being a conniving, selfish, and manipulative, experiences a bit of growth in this book. In the first book you would have never thought it would happen, but I was glad to see the character development.What I like about the Night World books is that while you could read each book separately as a stand-alone, it's great to see prior plot lines and character weaved into the current story. It makes you feel even more connected to the story and the world.These books are short reads, but I find them pretty satisfying because the plot moves along and it focuses on what you really want to see."

You'd Be Surprised,"Mary-Lynnette's wants seem simple enough. She likes her quiet life, stargazes as a hobby, bases her life around becoming an astronomer, and hopes the three new girls moving in next door with the kindly, if eccentric, Mrs. Burdock will help to bring her shy brother, Mark, out of his shell.Unfortunately, what she ends up with is a murder mystery, romance she doesn't want, and oh, yeah, those three new girls are vampires with a dangerous older brother coming to drag them back home.There are a LOT of characters to focus on, as per usual with a murder mystery. We have Mary-Lynnette, Mark, the three sisters Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade, their brother Ash, and the local werewolf, Jeremy. And those aren't even the suspects. The endless supply of characters in such a short amount of pages is a little overwhelming, with so many aspects of so many characters not fully explored. But what really gets the reader, even the fans of over ten years, is the star-crossed attraction between Mary-Lynnette and Ash.It's a bumpy road, to put it lightly. Mary-Lynnette is a simple, if nosy, human girl, while Ash is a dangerous, well-known vampire--and not well-known in the good sense, in Mary-Lynnette's book. Understandable; in Secret Vampire and Daughters of Darkness it's implied he's killed human girls and worse. There are very subtle hints at sexual abuse toward human females that younger readers may miss, but the words are enough to paint a picture that Ash is Very Bad.Many fans complain at the ending, but it is the ending that keeps them so captivated with these two. Mary-Lynnette wants to finish high school. She can't see herself with Ash as he is now, knowing his past. Ash is sorry and wants to repent, by the end of the novel, but wanting isn't enough. Mary-Lynnette is dealing with a soulmate who is potentially mentally unstable, definitely cruel, and by all human means, a classified felon (if he could be traced, that is).L.J. Smith did well in ending the story with no conclusion (which she has promised the fans would come at the end of the series for years; ten years later and still nothing). Ash needs room to grow in order to be someone Mary-Lynnette will not regret willingly falling in love with.This is a good book, by no means the best, but excellent for the series. It was the second book I read (no, Secret Vampire was not the first) and ultimately the one that got me hooked.Here's to hoping the Mary-Lynnette/Ash fans get closure in the near future.

Three beautiful sisters hide a deadly secret that threatens to be discovered by the inhabitants of a sleepy town. Rowan, Kestrel and Jade are on the run - from their families and from the Elders. They know that their brother Ash (James' cousin from Secret Vampire) is seeking them and that he is bent on returning them to the boring life they have led.Two siblings chance upon their secret and find themselves befriending vampires. As they learn more about the Night World, their own lives are turned upside down by a sickening deed. Who or what is it that stalks Briar Creek?Fantastic! I enjoyed this book immensely with its portrayal of two very different and yet similar families. The obvious difference is the species but the vampire girls have never had true freedom before while Mary-Lynette and Mark have lived their lives in a small town in the country. The similarities lie in the older sisters. Both fiercely protective of their siblings, they will do anything to keep them from harm.I loved the conflict between Ash and M'Lin, especially when they first meet. The story progressed well and unlike some stories, had a more convincing ending, rather than the sudden death of the baddie.

Night World: Daughters Of Darkness	Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,1/2,5.0,909878400,It is the best book in the series.,"This book was the best out of the whole series. The book was pretty much about Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel, three girl vampires that just had enough of the Night World. Mary-Lynnette is a small town girl who loves to look at the stars, but has nobody to look at the stars with her. Ash is a tall, lanky, and elegant vampire that has to find his sisters and bing them back home. But of course his sisters had told Mary-Lynnette and her brother, Mark, bout the Night World. Another twist in the story is that Ash and Mary-Lynnette are soulmates. If this story couldn't get anymore exciting there is a vampire killer running around town. All six of them has to figure out who this vampire killer is and stop him. Meanwhile Ash and Mary-Lynnette has to figure out what to do about each other. If you like or are obsess with vampires (Like me!)you should read this book."	R
Night World: Daughters Of Darkness	Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,1/2,5.0,876182400,If you're into vampire and romance you should read this book,"You might have read a lot of vampire-romance novels but this one certainly rates a 10. The story itself has a good plot and amazing characters to suit their purposes. The three sisters, Rowan, Kestrel and Jade, uncannily beatiful, are actually fugitives from Night World and their brother Ash is sent to take them home. Both male and female lead role are superb. Their roles fit them perfectly. Ash, a vampire whose whole life changed after finding his soulmate is a human and Mary-Lynette a girl with a strong character who wasn't really willing to accept the fact that Ash is her soulmate. And of course...the way the authour tells her story and the words she uses..it's absolutely incredible."	R

My reason is because MARY-LYNETTE S****D&gt; she was another one of LJ's cheesy perfect charactesr and the fact taht she ended up with the vampire hottie was blah, too predictable.

All of L.J. Smith's books are fantastic; she's my absolute favorite writer. Her writing style is very natural and realistic and her characters are so real, you start looking for them in real life. I fell in love with Ash, especially in how, even though he's a fierce vampire, he's completely helpless when it comes to Mary Lynette. Smith writes the most wonderful characters. I never liked fantasy or romance novels, but her books are a notable exception. My friends think I'm crazy because I'm in college and I'm still reading YA books, but, I'm telling you, her books are ageless!!! If you haven't read this, you're definitely missing out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Night World: Daughters Of Darkness	Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,,,,1/1,5.0,904694400,A love story for haters of love and romance,"Thought you would never ever fall in love? So did the hero (if you can call him that) of this story. Ash doesn't particularly like the idea of having to chase his little sisters across the country after they ran away from home. And when he finds them he doesn't exactly love the idea that they have also told humans about the Night World, a secret society of the supernatural. Or the idea that his youngest sister is in love with a human. But what's worse is Ash's soulmate is a smart, beautiful human from a hick town who hates him and everything he stands for. Also, what's worse, his great-aunt is killed with a stake meaning that somebody knew she was a vampire. All this adds up to the worst thing that can happen to a teenage boy who wants to prove that he hates humans, loves fast cars and even faster girls. This is the funniest, most ludicrous book you could ever expect to read from L.J.Smith. The characters are SOO familiar, you might expect to see them in school the next day. A must read for readers of all ages and COMEDY CENTRAL lovers."	R

You can tell Ash loves her from almost the begining.. the first time I read the book, i didnt get one part, but as u can see, i'm not dissing the book for it... the part where ash says &quot;Look...I might as well tell you. I didn't ask for this, and if somebody had said last week that I'd be in...involved... with a human, I'd have knocked his head off. I mean, after howels of derisive laughter. But.&quot; I doidn't catch what he was origenally goning to say... I'd be in LOVE, but he paused and changed the word love to involved. so while she sat there hating him, he loved her!! How blind can a girl get!! theres a fine guy there trippin over her, and she kickes him in the shin!!! twice!oh well. what I really want it a sequel though. I am just dien wonderin what happens. the lasy part where he said goodbye was soo good. If L J ever stops writing I am going to be sooooooo sad. but in conclusion, this was one of her best books.

But despite that nice turn of events, it does not change the fact that, well, this book tends to asume everyone likes happy endings full of love.

The paper is poor quality; it won't hold up under much erasing if you use pencil, and if you use gel pens, the ink bleeds through to the other side. The squares to color in are too large, making the finished image very pixillated and hard to make out.

The other major problem with this series is that many of the puzzles are large, so that in order to fit them in the book, the publishers have broken up the grid to fit half on one page and half on the other! I get so frustrated, I want to cut the puzzles out the book and tape them to another sheet of paper before I do them.I'd suggest Mind-Sharpening Pixel Puzzles and Perplexing Pixel Puzzles, both by Peter Gordon, or Games Magazine Presents Paint by Numbers instead of these books, because of their large format and quality paper."

America at 1750: A Social Portrait	America at 1750: A Social Portrait,,,,31/32,5.0,900288000,A superb snapshot of Colonial America up to 1750.,"The brilliant historian Richard Hofstadter was working on this book when he died in 1970. In eight highly readable chapters he presents clear discussions of several areas of Colonial America, among them: the explosion in population, the diverse ethnicity, the world of white indentured servents, black slavery and its trade, along with a discussion of the predominant middle class life many enjoyed, and finishes with three fine chapters on Colonial religion and the Great Awakening. His mastery of his subject matter and the clarity of his writing is a joy. The Scotch-Irish, the German religious sects who were excellent farmers, the terrified blacks kidnapped and marched 550 miles to the coast and into slavery, the desperate white indentured servents selling themselves into virtual slavery for a time, the always extremely dangerous ocean crossings, the greedy-yet terrified slaveholders and the cruel slave codes they wrote, the relatively prosperous Americans, the coming of G! ! eorge Whitefield--America's most spectacular preacher, the religious schisms that the Great Awakening brought: all these stories are here. And all packed into a highly readable book. A pleasure to read. Thank you Professor Hofstadter."	R

Hofstadter's last book, it was what was to begin a much larger, possibly three volume epic on the social conditions of America at distinctive periods in our history. And while this book is missing the fuller vision of a more articulated society, the chapters that are present are truly alive with insight and understanding of the way things probably were. Here we see the slave trade not just from a one-sided arcadia, but from every side, from the profiteers and the oppressed, from the African kings selling their nation to the early-day abolitionists mildly arguing their case. We see the white slaves too, the pains and humiliations of indentured servitude to the hearts and minds of men believing themselves at the very least a step up from inhumanity.Then there is the middle class of the pre-revolutionary colonies, filled with religious fanatics and patriotic zealots, all of them looking to make a buck. We see that this class formed the basic foundations of the nation to come and how the politicians of the day catered mostly to this hardly regal, far-reaching group of normal, everyday folks. This chapter, perhaps, gives the fullest picture of the society that was that went on to create the society we are today.And then there is a long discussion of the church and the 'Great Awakening' that plundered through the minds of so many post-witch hunting citizens. These chapters explain the foundations that led not just to a seperation of church and state, but to the required need for religious diversity and how this principle, above all else, came to found our subsequent ideas on American freedom.A glorious, neccessary book, it makes one mourn for this already celebrated historian and wonder what might have been (and regardless of that annoying cliche, one can't help but think in such basic praise dialect when finishing)."

Most of his previous work was analytic social history, more like sociology than what the popular mind may consider as history. Although that work was excellent and he proved himself an accomplished essayist, with this one he proves he has an excellent touch with narrative history. He can still singe right through to the heart of what makes the period studied a period that, whatever our superficial technological guises, we still live in.We have moved past slavery, which was so entrenched in American social structure in 1750. But the persistence with which Americans pursued slavery, as if they perceived it was the only way to build a nation and a new kind of nation, one built purely on self-interest, brings the reader to realize that the nation we live in now remains built on slavery. The vast semi-middle classes and lower classes remain slaves to their debased tastes, their lives must remain empty and out of their will's control so that their master's, the tiny set of property and power holders, may prosper and keep building, all for their own prospering only. At the same time, the masters tell these slaves it is all done for the glory of--back then it was ""God,"" now it is sometimes ""God"" and sometimes everyday mammon.Hofstadter also lets us see the centrality of religion in everyday American life at the same, another factor which has altered only superficially. If America continues to punish the flesh and look to some vague point in the future when God will make everything right, the precedence was there at 1750. If now we seem to live for today, it is not in terms of fully enriching ourselves within the potentials of this world below, but only in terms of momentary indulgences to keep us preoccupied until some dim future when all will be resolved and explained. Candy and candy music are the so-called indulgences, much as prayers and verse-reading were the momentary indulgences to keep the body bearing through this world until the next appeared.Always, Hosftadter reveals, without preaching. The reader can draw the conclusions, even if Hofstadter's brilliant supply of facts leads the careful reader to see the connections between yesterday and today. Considering this book came out four decades ago, it teaches a hard lesson, that the more America thinks it progresses, the more it becomes its same old self."	R

Knopf.This is a good time to read (or re-read) the histories of Richard Hofstadter, who explained the background of McCarthyism. McCarthyism is back, big time. The foreground is different. The background is the same.Hofstadter's writing career, 1944-1970, was almost exactly congruent with the first McCarthyism, and his gracefully written books were bestsellers among lovers of American liberty.The titles of the best-known reveal his thrust: ""Anti-intellectualism in American Life"": ""The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays""; ""Social Darwinism in American Thought""; ""The Development of Academic Freedom in the United States.""When he passed the age of 50, Hofstadter projected a massive social history of America, which would require 18 years to write. He died after completing only eight chapters of a scene-setting volume, which were published as ""America at 1750"" in 1971.So this little volume is a good place to start before returning to his earlier volumes. It was Hofstadter's opinion that by 1750, peculiarly American attitudes, customs, institutions and morals had formed after six or seven generations away from Europe, and that these were so powerful they still controlled much that we did two centuries later.He was certainly a believer in American exceptionalism, but unlike the antidemocratic, antiliberal ranters about American exceptionalism today, he did not think that everything America did and stood for was wise or benevolent; nor that anyone who dared to criticize our failings was a less than 100 percent American.The chapter headings reveal that. After an opening review of demographics, his first three substantive chapters are on forced labor, white and black; and the capitalist slave trade.Only after reminding us that America was a deeply flawed place does he begin writing about its attractive aspects in ""The Middle Class World.""One aspect of American exceptionalism is that it was history's first majority middle class community.Hofstadter died too soon to remonstrate against the destruction of the middle class in favor of finance capitalism, but he was aware of the threat.His final three chapters are about religion, particularly the Great Awakening in the 1740s.Until then, Americans were unchurched, in the main, although there were established churches in many colonies that taxed everybody.But believers and unbelievers who disdained to pay for someone else's church were free to move, and did.Americans evolved a wholly secular idea of government, not because they were irreligious (which they weren't even if unchurched) but because no sect (after the early days in New England) could command the adherence of a large enough majority to persecute the rest. Thus, the idea of toleration, which was, for most, limited to toleration of Protestants.But it was a good start."	R

I'm new to Chicago, and I want to find the places to go off the beaten path.I wish I had skimmed the book before I bought it. In this book, the author reviews places he feels one needs to see. Review after review of restaurants and clubs and stores, the author used descriptions like, ""decent"" and ""nondescript."" In one review, he claims he is ""a tad ambivalent"" about that specific restaurant, and in another, he reviews a bar as being the sort that ""you never want to go to but find yourself in anyway."" Even the places he talked about positively, he never got excited about them. The most you'll get is a restaurant that serves food that is ""quite good."" He spends a good chunk of the book talking about how he is an ""old man"" now, and talks about things he did when he was young and what the neighborhoods of Chicago were like years ago, and in many of his reviews he admits that he hasn't been to that place in some time. This is fine if that's what you are looking for, but I would recommend a book on Chicago history if that's the case.

The images are taunting and very nicely rendered, however, there are some strong hidden meanings within them.

Pullen, in his seminal work ""The Twentieth Maine"" describes Ellis Spear as a determined man with a dry sense of humor, the kind to ""take the convervative view of men and events."" Ellis Spear, a schoolteacher prior to the war, joined the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment as a lieutenant in 1862. He would over the course of the Civil War rise to the commissioned rank of Colonel and the brevet rank of Brigadier General, a remarkable performance for a man with no prior military training. His duties with the 20th Maine would take him everywhere the Union Army of the Potomac traveled from late 1862 through Appomattox in 1865. As a Major, Spear was often the day-to-day commander of the 20th after August 1863.The 20th Maine is rather more famous than most volunteer regiments, thanks to its heroic fight on Little Round Top on the second day of the Battle of Gettyburg, a stand dramatized by Jeff Shaara in the novel ""Killer Angels"" and in the movie ""Gettysburg."" Spear's recollection of that day varies in the details from the traditional account presented by Pullen but this probably says more about how confusing a battle can be, especially when recollected thirty or forty years later, than about any real contradition in facts.""Recollections"" actually has three parts: Spear's notes jotted down during the war itself; a first attempt at writing them up in narrative form around 1896, and a more finished attempt undertaken sometime after 1900. The post-1900 attempt is the most readable, and is presented first. It should be read in close conjunction with the end notes to understand the context in which Spear was writing. A comparison with the other versions provides an interesting lesson in historiography.Spear's recollections document the life of the regiment in camp and on campaign. He details the challenges posed by the weather, the terrain, the poor food, the often indifferent leadership, and the Confederates themselves. Spear writes in a matter-of-fact manner, interspersed with the kind of understated dry humor well-known to those who have lived in Down East Maine. His story is a remarkable tribute to the toughness of Civil War volunteers, who soldiered under sometimes appallingly bad conditions with grumpy good humor and perseverence. Spear comes across in this narrative as a dedicated, common sense officer who conscientiously carries out his duties. Spear's gift for observation captures, among other events, some excellent vignettes of the temporary truces established by opposing picket lines, the sometimes strange persistence of good manners in the midst of war, and the inherent brutality of combat.This book is highly recommended to students of the Civil War and to casual readers looking for a sense of the times."

The final meeting between Bruno and Laura came across as too contrived and unbelievable.I also agree with another reviewer, in that I didn't see where the Mafia plot was necessary.

You can walk the back streets, visit the markets and learn about the great Roman love of traditional food.My only criticism is that Laura is perhaps a bit over-drawn: she is too obviously a character created by a man rather than a woman and reminded me a little too much of the much admired Nigella Lawson.I agree with the reviewer who enjoyed the little asides of very rude Italian slang - a guide on what not to say when in Rome!I will most certainly be looking for other books by this most welcome new author."

Perry Mason in the Case of Too Many Murders	Perry Mason in the Case of Too Many Murders,,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,Acute Observer,3/3,4.0,1104451200,The Case of the Double Murder,"In Chapter 1 Gil Adrian walks into the Oaks Restaurant. Gil has been accused of bribing city and state politicians, and being connected to organized crime. A stranger joins him, and they begin to leave. Suddenly, Gil shoots this stranger and takes off in his black Mercedes. The police are called, and go to Adrian's house. They find Gil's wife outside, enter the house, and find Gil dead in the den from two shots to his head! [Gardner always played down the background corruption in his stories. The idea of a double murder popped into to my mind.] Chapter 2 provides an example of wrongful conviction, which happens more often than the dramas on TV would suggest. This is an omen for Chapter 3, where Mrs. Gil Adrian, the trophy wife, retains Perry Mason. Laurel doesn't know much about Gil's business, or of any powerful enemies. Does the political establishment want to hang the murder on Laurel and thus bury the scandal? Mason learns the stranger Gil shot was unidentified; all he had was cash, a phony driver's license, and a .22 pistol strapped to his ankle. Wasn't a .22 pistol the weapon of choice for hit men asks Mason? Mason contacts David Niles, a Federal prosecutor, and suggests an alliance. [This never happened in the original series, to my recollection.]Chapter 8 tells of the beating that was given to Paul Drake Jr. after he questions Anselmo Costa in Las Vegas. Perry Mason also visits Las Vegas to ask questions, but learns little more. The preliminary hearing in Chapter 19 is as good as Gardner's best. It tells why a defendant shouldn't wear sunglasses. Chapter 20 explains why getting testimony about 'Karl Braundorff' was important. This led to Janet Coleman, a 'roper' (like Raymond Schindler), who told of Gil Adrian's visit to Las Vegas. Then Anselmo Costa is summoned to the witness stand, but he asserts his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Perry Mason gets a clue from the artist drawings on TV. The bank is subpoenaed to find the last check written by Ralph Adrian, Gil's son, before Ralph was murdered. These clues help to solve the puzzle, and Laurel Adrian is freed.This story brings in updated procedures (the defense gets a list of the prosecutor's witnesses), and mentions the terrible traffic in Los Angeles since the 1960s. But the flavor of the original stories has been lost. Paul Drake has retired, and Perry Mason would be an octogenarian, if still alive. What is missing is a younger lawyer, Perry Jr. or Della Mason, to carry on the father's work. This story is like a good reproduction of an old master like Rembrandt, but in a modern setting. It lacks the dedications that were part of the original series."	R
Perry Mason in the Case of Too Many Murders	Perry Mason in the Case of Too Many Murders,,A1S3C5OFU508P3,Charles Ashbacher,1/1,4.0,1293926400,An enjoyable story if you can accept the new style,"The Perry Mason stories by Erle Stanley Gardner were written in such a distinctive style that it is easy to recognize and hard to mimic. Therefore, any fan of Perry Mason will have to accept the disappointment of reading this Mason book by another author of another time. Gardner's style and tone very much that of the thirties and forties, with different terminology and a different level of acceptance regarding how men looked at women.If you are capable of accepting the significant difference in style, then this book can be enjoyed. Some of the characters are changed, for example it is now Paul Drake Jr. doing the investigations and Ray Dallas has replaced Lieutenant Tragg. The hostility between Mason and the police has been replaced by a relationship of mutual respect, within the bounds of their professional rivalry; Ray Dallas and Mason are friends.The story is formulaic of the Mason stories, a man is murdered and his estranged wife is falsely accused of the murder. Mason must piece together a series of sometimes-contradictory clues in order to unmask the guilty and free his client. In true Mason fashion, his questioning of a witness leads to a dramatic courtroom event where the murderer is revealed.Although Gardner wrote many Perry Mason stories and they follow a pattern, there are reasons to always want additional stories. Chastain's effort is a worthy addition to this set, while naturally different, it is still within the bounds of what a Perry Mason story should be."	R

I am a single parent of a 5 year old little boy who is very stubborn - every conversation and request is a battle. I have felt like all I do is nag and argue with him and can't even remember the last time that we had a ""good day"". I am very consistent with him and with disciplining, but he still constantly manipulates and argues over everything and it is mentally and physicaly tiring. It has been this way for about a year now and I have been at my wits end. I feel like I have tried every parenting book out there & nothing has worked. UNTIL NOW !! I read this book last week - it was a quick read, about 1 1/2 hours. This book has changed my life and it works !! I love this book because it focuses on only 2 or 3 skills that you can quickly learn and implement. Instead of the typical thick parenting book that is overwhelming and you are not sure where to begin...this book spells it out for you. It gives you DETAILED examples of situations and what to say in these situations. I have only used the techniques for about a week, but it has already changed our lives. My son spent this entire last weekend without arguing with me. I can't remember the last time that happened. We actually were able to spend some great quality time together and were loving and affectionate instead of having a power struggle. My favorite strategies in the book are the ""I know"" , ""Nice try"" and ""I love you too much to argue"". I told all of my friends to buy this book. I can't recommend this book highly enough!!!

I enjoy sitting down with a 200+ page book, but not so my husband. I have been trying to get him on board with the Love and Logic program, but he will not sit and read a book for that long! So when I saw this book, I thought it might peak his interest enough to get him to read it. This book is much shorter than some of the others and it thoroughly addresses problems associated with discipline. As with all of their books, there are lots of anecdotal stories with clear examples. He still didn't read the whole book, but he did walk away with a better understanding of the methods used. I found it a breeze to read and it was nice to have all of the discipline techniques in one easy to read book. I also think it is a nice follow up to the Love and Logic books. After using Love and Logic for awhile, I have noticed that sometimes I get a little lax and then discipline issues start to creep up again. I keep this book handy just to remind myself to keep up with the program. It is much easier to quickly skim this short book than break out the original love and logic book and search for discipline. since beginning the program almost 2 years ago, parenting has been a lot more fun!

Dinner At Antoine's	Dinner At Antoine's,,A1SG05N5ZLSYAD,Laura L. Wines,42/42,5.0,961113600,&quot;Dinner at Antoine's: An Intriguing Mystery Set in New Orlea,"&quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; written by Frances Parkinson Keyes is set in New Orleans during Carnival Season in January 1948. It is a mystery that endures the generations. I first read &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; ten years ago in 1990. I enjoyed the book so much that it inspired me to make a trip to the Crescent City. My love for the book has not died since that first reading.The mystery is terrific. When I began my second read of the book in May 2000, I was quickly swept into the plot. I didn't want to stop reading. The book is so well written that the characters, plot and setting come to life before the reader. As Ruth Avery, the main character, sees New Orleans for the first time, I too saw the city for the first time through her eyes. The author gives a complete picture of New Orleans society in 1948 through the many characters that she develops. Joe Racina and his wife Judith are middle class residents. Joe works as a reporter and Judith maintains their home. Judith has chosen not to hire help as she grew up in Connecticut on a farm. To the opposite extreme you have the Lanlande family at the top of society. Other characters include Russell Aldridge, architect; Vance Perrault, doctor; and Tossie Pride, personal maid. &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; is an old fashion murder mystery that in the style of Agatha Christie is full of suspects. Once again I was intrigued until the end as I remained unsure of the murderer's identity until it was revealed. This book is by far the author's best and it makes you beg for a sequel.The added bonus to &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; are the physical descriptions of landmarks in New Orleans. The descriptions are so great that this book could almost be categorized as a travel essay. When I traveled to New Orleans, I used &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; as my guide. I quickly found Antoine's Restaurant and in the restaurant I found the Rex Room, 1840 Room, and Mystery Room just as the restaurant had been described by the author. The French bread, tomato aspic, oysters Foch, flaming pressed duck with cream and brandy, cherries Jubilee, and caf&eacute; brulot all enticingly described by the author can still be found on the menu. I quickly moved on throughout New Orleans finding the Court of the Two Sisters, Caf&eacute; Du Monde, the French Market, Jackson Square, the cathedral, St. Charles Avenue, the Garden District, Audubon Park, and the Metaire Cemetery. My most recent reading of the book has me wanting to return to discover the River Road and to find out if the Bar None Restaurant exists with its barbecued chicken, onion rings and corn fritters. Even if I find that the River Road and Bar None only exist in the author's imagination, she has so aptly described them that I will always feel as if I have actually visited.Reading &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; is the perfect way to spend a weekend when you want to take a luxurious vacation in the comfort of your home."

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",36/40,4.0,994464000,Entertaining tale of old New Orleans,"Half soap, half Agatha Christie mystery, this story of New Orleans in the late 1940s is a charming and compelling story of love, deception, and murder. Populated by a complex and endearing (or repelling) cast of characters, this is an excellent story. (And why isn't it in print?!)Starting off at the restaurant Antoine's, it follows extremely rich playboy Orson Foxworth (yes, that is his real name) introducing his lovely niece Ruth Avery to the rich'n'famous of New Orleans. Among them are the beautiful Amelie Lalande, a self-absorbed but very lovely widow that Foxworth wants as a lover but is willing to marry; Odile St. Amand, Amelie's daughter, who is suffering from a disease she tries to hide; Leonce St. Amand, Odile's philandering husband; Caresse Lalande, Odile's little sister who is on the brink of a full-fledged affair with Leonce; Vance Perrault, a doctor who cares deeply for Odile; Odile's ex-lover, Sabin Duplessis; Joe Racina, a brilliant journalist, and many many others...After a fateful night where Odile's shaking hands cause her to spill wine on herself (similar to a bloodstain), Amelie refuses Foxworth's proposal as she doesn't want to leave her poor invalid daughter alone, and Leonce attempts a seduction. Motives are abundant when Odile is found dead in her bedroom - shot through the heart with a gift from her ex-lover. Many lives and destinies will change (some for the better, some for worse) before Odile's killer finds justice of a sort...The pace is pleasant and gradual, allowing us excellent insight into the characters. The descriptions of luxurious houses, restaurants and clothing (especially clothing!) are evocative and entertaining. No threads are left untangled, and the question of motive and reason is, frankly, as excellent as that of the Grand Mistress of Mystery, Agatha Christie.There is only one thing that kept this from being a five-star book: As it was written in 1948, this book has a rather stereotyped portrayal of African Americans, especially Odile's loving nurse Tossie. Despite the stereotype, I was pleased that Tossie was not played for laughs and was one of the more insightful characters in the story. The reader automatically connects with her (especially regarding her low, low, LOW opinion of Leonce) and is warmed by the last chapter regarding her.Though Ruth Avery is sort of the heroine, she is nevertheless not the central character. She is strong and independent, with little thought of social position; and, after Odile's murder, so is Caresse (whom I expected to hate but ended up liking). I hated Leonce, was charmed by Orson Foxworth and Joe Racina. I found the character of Amelie Lalande to be highly annoying, with her self-centered artificiality.Though there are a few pitfalls in this book, it is nevertheless an entertaining (and pretty clean as well) story about mystery and passion in New Orleans, a beautiful city. Well worth the read."	R

Dinner At Antoine's	Dinner At Antoine's,,A229U5V2OK7B4D,strickn,1/4,3.0,1186185600,Decoy Mystery,"Picked this recently from Grandmother's shelf; she'd never read it, but her few months living in New Orleans were right around the time of the book. It will be hard for enlightened readers to believe that upper /lower classes would behave and communicate in stereotyped ways; umbrage is mis-taken. Not only can you trust an observant outsider resident of New Orleans writing in 1948 to have a perspective on 1948 New Orleans superior in details to that of postmodern criticism, but it's also easily forgotten by outsiders, even after this hurricane, that, in this city more than any other, people lived their lives in one or two neighborhoods. In other words, life itself was, from an educational standpoint, simplistic and regressive. Craving high-mindedness, a fatalistic New Orleanian you never will be. It's faintly surprising that people want it dressed up. This work sure doesn't oblige (attention to fashion and finery notwithstanding). Most of its characters do suit a place so set'n its ways that, even as the book was being written, leadership was passing to the smaller (later giant), more creative city that would eventually come to N.O.'s aid from a few hundred miles to the west.It would be standard (and a bit inaccurate) to say the setting is a character here. However, I will say something you rarely hear: stories exist so that the author has something on which to put the real communication. Forget the mystery. I'm nogood at figuring them out, yet I did. That's not what to read for. I read to soak in the place, the author's devotion to it, and then it just fits that the most humbly local person, the part of the tapestry the astute reader kept expecting to find dirt on, is revealed to have been good all along."

Hopkins,3/9,3.0,1153785600,Very dated and predictable mystery,"I decided to read this book after a visit to New Orleans when I toured the home of the author. The book was mentioned during the tour as one of her most famous books.I can see why it is out of print. I almost quit reading it after 50 pages. To become classics, books need to have universal qualities that transcend time and place. Dinner at Antoines is filled with stereotypes.As another reviewer pointed out, the depiction of blacks in the novel is condescending and dated. They all talk like characters in ""Uncle Remus.""The blacks are not the only ones who talk like caricatures. The policeman Murphy talks like an Irish cop from the movies.Other characters also are stereotypes. They are the ruthless businessman (Foxworth), the shallow woman out for his money (Amelie), the noble statesman (Huntington), the philandering husband (Leonce), the flirt (Caresse), Latin beauty (Clarinda), caring old doctor the tough-talking policeman, the rugged archeologist, etc. None of them seemed real to me.The main women characters are interested only in clothes and men. Ruth is a rich 20-something clothes horse with a silver mink coat. Clarinda is considered an old maid at 27. Caresse goes to New York to become a model for a staid department store. None of them seems to have a brain.The plot also seemed a little creaky to me. I figured out ""who done it"" about half way through the book, even though many characters had a motive and there were clues pointing at several. I also easily figured out who would marry whom at the end.Another plot flaw is tha author does a lot of telling readers about characters and what is going on rather than demonstrating it by action.Most of the plot takes place over a week, yet a murder is comitted and solved, an engagement takes place and is broken and replaced by another, and Ruth agrees to fly to Hondourus marry a man she has known a week.As an example of 1950s race, class, and gender stereotypes taken to an extreme, the book is interesting. It was somewhat entertaining, but totally unbelievable. I did not believe in the world portrayed.That is the main difference between a classic like Agatha Christie's novels and this book. I believe in the worlds Christie creates, though they are set in past times and distant places. However, I feel that Parkinson's New Orleans is an unbelievable place with unbelievable people."	R
The Faces of Homoeopathy	The Faces of Homoeopathy,,A3FTFSK7XIJZBH,Tal Davidson,2/2,5.0,985046400,The Truth About Homeopathy,"Julian Winston's novel is the most in-depth and informative discussion on homeopathy that I have come across. The book makes good on its claim to insightfully delve into the fundamental philosophy of homeopathy. Also, Winston tackles the important and controversial question of scientific rigor that plagues this medical breakthrough. He makes it systematically clear how the medical philosophy of homeopathy is scientifically rigorous. Also mentioned are the innovative medical thinkers known as the original homoeopaths, the decline of homeopathy at the beginning of the 20th century, and the resurgence of this medical philosophy towards the end of this same century. It is ideal for those readers attempting to gain greater medical recognition of homeopathy or for those just interested in the history of this innovative healthcare technique. If one is looking for in-depth inforamtion on homeopathy that is historical, academic, and interesting, then The Faces of Homeopathy is in my opinion the best book to buy."	R

People like me who already know HTML and supporting technologies like CSS will defenitely rue the fact that they didn't lay their hands on this book earlier. Beginners this is the only book you'll need on HTML for a long while.My fundamentals were accumulated as a result of many books on this subject as well as the effort of scanning millions of emails on mailing lists. All in all sheer experience. The author has done it all for you. It's all there in one place, follow this book and you'll end up not making too many mistakes.I often get people asking me about something or the other regarding HTML / client side web development. I always refer them to this book. And no their queries aren't as simple as &quot;What are the params for an anchor tag?&quot;. That any book on HTML can answer. It would be more like &quot;I just can't get this page to have the same gap between two tables. All my code is perfect, I'm at my wits end!&quot;. The answer would be something only an expert can point out, like &quot;Hey you have a newline between your tables in your code. Yes HTML doesn't care about newlines but some browsers do.&quot;Truly this book will answer a lot of questions like that. If you ever are gonna work with HTML or have been working with HTML but haven't read this book, your eyes will be opened either by the fact that you didn't know so many things, or by the fact that a human being could stuff so many facts into a single book.If you are the type who needs a pocket reference maybe you are at the wrong place, but then perhaps you'd demand a pocket reference for building a space craft too!

They're supposedly all in the 250-page Appendix A, but to find one you have to go to the Appendix A section in the table of contents at the beginning of this bulky 1100-page tome, look up the page # listed there, then go to that page. The obvious alternative would be phonebook-style page headers showing the first tag name on each page so readers could locate a tag of interest directly. Why wouldn't a tech book publisher have this figured out?The cover says &quot;up-to-date for latest versions&quot; of Netscape and IE without specifying dates or version #'s. The printing date is hidden in the ISBN code. I find this practice questionable.Although pages 7 and 682 say all documents should begin with &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;, this tag does not seem to be fully described anywhere. The syntax suggested on p. 682 (with a single pair of quotes) conflicts with the HTML 4 examples on p. 60.The book cover trumpets &quot;comprehensive&quot; coverage of HTML 4 as well as: &quot;extensive details on Cascading Style Sheets 1 &amp; 2.&quot; One could be forgiven for figuring this means fairly full coverage of CSS. However, the preface draws a distinction between HTML and CSS, speaking of &quot;HTML 4 ... _along with_ new technologies that affect HTML, such as CSS ...&quot; and announces an intention &quot;to do one thing the best I can: cover HTML.&quot; The implicit disclaimer is not idle. Whatever the process that upgraded the previous edition to this one, this book is by no means a comprehensive reference for CSS."	R

There's some sections in the book that probably could quite easily have been cut or shrunk down. I kind of got the feeling that they wanted to stretch the book out to 1200 pages as a marketting ""Look at how huge our book is!"" thing. They probably could have made it ~1000 pages rather easily, which would have made the book easier to handle.In addition, some sections of the book are somewhat outdated.

The next 475 pages provide a well-organized presentation of HTML mechanics including presentation, layout, cascading style sheets, client/server side programming, DHTML, XML, and web hosting. Throughout this material, sample code is presented and explained to illustrate the concepts presented. Finally, 430 pages of appendices provide reference level detail that will remain valuable indefinitely.The later chapters (programming, DHTML, XML) are overview in nature. (ASP is discussed in five pages.) This is appropriate, for each of these subjects requires a text of their own. The overviews are valuable as they present these subjects in the context of HTML and how they can work together. They also give the reader a basic platform from which to study in greater detail.Certainly worth mentioning also are the numerous tips and valuable remarks sprinkled throughout the book.

The browser versions expected to be in common use for the next few years of Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, WebTV, and a few others, and how to allow for their different interpreting capabilities , is covered throughout the book.Hundreds of pages of appendixes explain what you can and can't do with HTML elements and style sheets. The function, power, and use of Java Script in its several variations are explained with examples. Author Thomas A. Powell, an expert Web consultant and Internet applications teacher at University of California at San Diego, explains the centrality of HTML while predicting changes that XML and other methods may bring in the future. He cites lots of free online Web sites, at all levels, to augment material in the book.We found the writing style, loaded with useful examples and stabs of humor, to be an easy read.

HTML: The Complete Reference	HTML: The Complete Reference,,,,7/7,3.0,966124800,Not Good Enough,"I bought this book based on the Amazon Reviews and after using it I must disagree with the weight of on-line opinion. Not that it is a bad book. It just isn't what the reviews led me to expect. My main disappointment is the poor structure and organization. It has a thrown-together feel, more like a collection of separate and poorly integrated sections than a single well-organized book.Some examples: Even after marking the page edges it is still difficult to find what I want quickly. The text sections are only average and not at all comprehensive. To learn HTML or CSS, you'd be better off getting a book (or books) that is not trying to be everything at once. And the reference sections are also a disappointment. The main headers do not stand out from the repeated subheadings so one becomes lost easily. There is not enough detail on differences between the major browsers. The CSS &quot;reference&quot; is a mess. It is broken into subsections which disrupt the alphabetical order and is sorely lacking in the kind of detail that is critical to successful style-sheet implementation.As I said, it's not a bad book. It's just not good enough. For total newbies, Castro's QuickStart Guide is far superior. On CSS, try O'Reilly's &quot;definitive&quot; guide. Not sure what to recommend as an HTML reference.

I checked the errata section of the website but not a single error in the book was listed there (at the time of writing this). I can't believe they are unaware of them, especially as this book has been out for several months now.Secondly the author keeps plugging his other book, so much so that he includes an entire chapter from that book here. Although it may of had some relevance I don't think it should of been added, as in my opinion it was clearly intended as a promotion of his other publication. I certainly don't object to being made aware of an authors publications, for instance in a list at the end of the book, but not like this.On the plus side this book does cover HTML exceptionally well, all the expected stuff like frames, tables, layers, forms, links, media types etc are explored. XHTML is also covered but don't expect much, the differences are only in the rules of writing the language, which are explained. Note that there isn't a chapter dedicated to XHTML but you are made aware of the differences between HTML mark-up and XHTML mark-up when necessary.Like previous editions this book does cover a lot of theory, e.g. logical versus physical mark-up, protocols, mime types, parsed html etc.There is also a chapter dedicated to CSS1 and CSS2 which is pretty complete. The CSS2 section includes coverage on the various new pseudo elements and selectors introduced in CSS2. There is also a reference section covering CSS1 and CSS2 at the back of the book, and it includes proprietary properties for Internet Explorer.SSI is also covered in this book. There are also very basic introductions to XML, JavaScript, server side technologies and DHTML. These are more about what they can do as opposed to teaching you them.The reference section has been organised alphabetically this time, so it is much easier to use than previous editions. They include coverage of XHTML, additions to WebTV, JavaScript event handlers and the usual HTML stuff. There are also reference sections for colour codes and character entities.Finally this is the first Complete Reference book I have purchased that didn't fall apart, so there is no need to buy a binder this time around."

As another example, the author mentions a trick of prefetching an image by rendering it with a height of 1 and width of 1.

The biggest flaw in this book, however, is the lack of emphasis on XHTML. The cover boasts that it includes full XHTML within it; however, it is really only one chapter out of the whole book. As someone who likes to keep up with the W3C standards and current technology on web pages, I have found that out of this entire book, I really only use chapter 13 which is on style sheets. I read the book and got to this chapter only to realize that everything I had just read wasn't information I could use.This book also includes an introduction to other aspects of HTML such as JavaScript and Server Side Programming, as well as, web maintenance. However, it only serves as an introduction and points the reader to other books. This book is great as an overview, but it does a poor job at helping you move from reading about HTML to actually doing the current HTML you would see on your favorite website.I would recommend finding a book on CSS and XHTML that gives a short introduction to the basics of HTML and then gives more emphasis on the current technology being used."

I was so happy with that book that when I went looking for an HTML manual, the first one I looked at was this one. And it's a good thing I did, because it's the only book I ever need to look at for a reference. It really does contain everything I can think I would need to write HTML code at any level of complexity or depth, and I've been writing HTML code since 1994, professionally since around 1997. If you're a beginner, the book spends some time in the beginning teaching you the basics and concepts, everything you should need to get started on your first pages. And if you're a novice or expert, the book will scale to your level of knowledge gracefully, it covers the gamut, even extending into Cascading Style Sheets, Dynamic HTML and a brief introduction to XML (if you need an XML manual you should get one dedicated only to XML, this reference is not complete for that purpose). The title couldn't be more appropriate, as inside the book, there is a complete reference of every single valid HTML tag and attribute you could use, even including explanations for what each attribute means! If you get just one HTML book, get this one.Keep in mind that this book does not cover any WYSIWYG tools for creating HTML pages (such as FrontPage or Dreamweaver).

However only the first few hundred pages cover HTML, and it's covered extremely well to. If you have read any other book on HTML then you won't believe just how much has been missed out until you read this book. HTML is much bigger than you would have ever thought.The book teaches you a lot of theory, areas such as logical and physical structure, doctype definitions, media types, encoding types (to name but a few) are explored, and the usual tutorials on tables, frames, linking, image maps, graphics, meta tags etc are all there, but more information is provided.There is also a chapter dedicated to style sheets which covers both CSS1 and CSS2. As HTML 4.0 encourages you to use style sheets instead of standard HTML, it was good to see this chapter. This was my first exposure to CSS and I'm very confident using it now. I don't believe you will have to buy an additional book on CSS.Other chapters include introductions to other technologies like JavaScript, server side programming, XML and DHTML, but these are only basic introductions, do not expect to learn these technologies from those chapters, they just give you a taste.The remainder of the book consists of the reference sections. These throughly cover (among other things) HTML and CSS. The HTML section includes additional tags and attributes specific to each browser, including those for webTv. Character encoding is also covered.I have only two criticisms of this book. Firstly it falls apart in your hands, so if you buy it expect to buy a binder as well. Secondly although the reference section is full and complete it isn't laid out very well.To sum up this book is both a tutorial and a reference and is always on my desk.I also own the third edition of this book but I don't think it is as good as this edition."

If you are trying to learn enough to tweak existing simple sites (my objective) then there is a lot of unnecessary stuff. I have to admit that the tone bothered me as well; it seems the author complained constantly that the web designers were not using HTML &quot;properly&quot; - too many workarounds, etc. Real life doesn't always conform with intent!I use the book as a reference but have found it easier to learn things from on-line sources and real life code."

This band deals with the first true encounter between the fledgling fleet of Terra and the might of the galactic empire.In ""The Cosmic Decoy"" we are reunited with Cadet Julian Tifflor, whom we met in the Mutant Master trilogy of stories. Cadet Tifflor is chosen by Perry Rhodan to become a Cosmic Decoy. At least four of the ships of the Terranian fleet have disappeared, and Rhodan wants to know where they went.In just the first book, we discover that the four missing ships were stolen by the Springers, a race of space-faring traders with no morals other than their own. Julian is prepared for this mission with a ""secret"" message - and a hidden special transmitter that is only capable of being received by people with telepathic powers, such as several members of Rhodan's Mutant Corps. Even Tifflor is unaware that he is a living psychic transmitter. According to plan, Tifflor is kidnapped by the Springers, but he is whisked away to a secret base before Rhodan and his men can catch up. We meet a few of the Springers and begin the process via which Rhodan plans to make the universe believe that the Earth has been destroyed.Next episode - Number 23 - ""Fleet of the Springers"".I've never been this impressed by a series. I'm reminded of old cliffhanger serials like ""Buck Rodgers"" or ""Flash Gordon"" when reading these marvelous books. This series is still being published in Germany and is now well over 2,000 stories. It's too bad American publishers stopped after only about 120 books. I had to learn to speak, read, and write German in order to continue reading Perry Rhodan.This book contains another editorial, another science fiction movie section, and another letters column. There are also extra stories - one continuing adventure, similar to a serial, and some ""Shock Shorts"" - continuing a series of SF short stories at the end of each book. Although these stories have nothing to do with Perry Rhodan, they are worth looking at.It's well worth reading the entire Rhodan series."	R

Each character feels out of place in society and clings to each other only to find that they are even out of place with each other.After drifting apart for a few years, their parents take action to bring them together. They orchestrate a dinner to celebrate the life of Princess Diana and watch the live coverage of her funeral. During the course of the dinner, Justin is outed, Tien's fiance is knocked unconscious, everyone is ashamed when it occurs to them that they forgot Gibbo's birthday. And to top it off, the food is awful!Despite this disastrous dinner, it sets a series of events in motion to reconcile not only the three friends, but the families. In the worst of times, Justin's in a coma, Tien is getting divorced, and Gibbo is accused of being a stalker, they all come together to support each other.This book is captivating from the start and is wonderfully written. The author takes you on a journey with each character, bringing depth and perspective to the series of events. I came away from this book having learned something about people, life and relationships. For instance:Tien's mother, Lihn, in love with a black American solider, is rejected by her family for her love. In a letter to her father, she quotes a Vietnamese author I'd never heard of before, Nguyen Du:""It blows one day & rains the nextHow often does chance favor us in the Spring?If you ignore and scorn my desperate loveyou'll hurt me- yet what will it profit you?""The Tale of KieuThis passage struck me as relevant to my own life as many of my friends are in the stage of life where they are deciding who to spend the rest of their lives with. Not everyone is making good choices, in my opinion, and it's always difficult to know when you should speak up to prevent disaster and when to let people make their own mistakes. There were other passages and messages in this book that were thought provoking and had me reflecting on my life.As good of a book as this was, I still have to give it an overall rating of a 4-stars because of the ending. It was a little too....... happily ever after, for my taste."	R

It is basically a story about three friends with multi-cultural backgrounds. Justin Cheong is a Chinese-Australian who is the picture-perfect son. His world becomes increasingly unstable as he comes to terms with his attraction to other men. Tien is the child of a Vietnamese woman and an African-American soldier. Living with her aunt and uncle in Australia, she straddles worlds of identity between Asian culture, Australian culture and wondering about her American father. Gibbo is a Caucasian Australian whose culture serves as a foil to the Asian. Overweight, Gibbo lacks confidence. He bonds with Justin & Tien as outcasts.Teo sets up the classic ""No Exit"" triangle where Justin loves Gibbo, Gibbo loves Tien, and Tien loves Justin. After the elementary to high school years, the friends draw apart. Justin goes camping with Gibbo with unfortunate results. Tien goes to prom with Gibbo with unfortunate results. The novel reunites them toward the end of college @ the Dead Diana Dinner (DDD) where relatives gather to morn the loss of the British princess and watch her funeral on TV. Here, the parents begin to take center stage and we go through their history. Gibbo's mom has been like a mother to Tien, but backs off when Tien's mother Linh finally arrives in Australia from Vietnam, via a Malaysian refugee camp. Gibbo's dad is a brusque medical doctor who gets upset with Justin's dad Tek and spills the beans about Justin's sexual orientation. Meanwhile, everyone has forgotten that this is also the meek Gibbo's 21st birthday. Tien plans to announce her engagement to Stanley, but Gibbo's mom knocks him out thinking she's caught an intruder.From the DDD, the novels spends several chapter in flashback as we learn all about Linh's history and her love affair with American GI Bucky. We also flash forward to see Tien in San Francisco with her husband Stanley and follow them through his modern art phase and Tien's flirtation with a new age feminist group that enjoys giving themselves haircuts in private places. Justin's life resembles that country song, ""Looking for love in all the wrong places."" Meanwhile, Gibbo develops an unwelcome attachment to Linh.This episodic novel sounds a bit melodramatic, but reads well. The characters are distinct and interesting, although none are perfect. Teo tries wax philosophical about the weaving of relationships into a lifetime pattern. For me, the Asian cultural self-analysis was interesting as people from various cultural backgrounds try to establish their own roots. Enjoy!"	R

It is the exclamation of Jacob who, upon waking from his dream about the ladder connecting heaven and earth, makes a startling realisation about the reality of the seemingly mundane and ordinary place where he had stopped for the night.In the prologue, Kushner develops an exegesis and hermeneutic of Genesis 28:16 more fully, and in so doing, illustrates many of the problems we regularly encounter, both in reading scripture as well as in interpreting daily life experience. He places this story in strong connection with the ordinary, even relating the angels on the ladder to common humanity:`There is another, even more obvious interpretation. The angels did not reside in heaven at all. They lived on earth. They were ordinary human beings. And, like ordinary human beings, they shuttled back and forth between heaven and earth. The trick is to remember, after you descend, what you understood when you were high on the ladder.'Kushner examines the way in which sages have interpreted this passage, and provides insights into history, psychology, philosophy, and scriptural study in the process. Each interpretation has had what one might call a personal conversation and experience with Jacob. In fact, each of these interpreters is portrayed as being on the ladder, rising and descending. The text is structured in this way. The interpreters are:+RashiSchelomo ben Yitzhaki, RashiThe key word for this interpretation is awareness. This is very important for making the kind of realisation that Jacob made. It is very important for us as we perceive the presence of God in our own lives.If I had known God was here, I wouldn't have gone to sleep.+KotzkMenachem Mendl of KotzkThe key concept here is egotism. Only by stripping away the ego can one begin to understand the presence and the personality of God.God was here because I was able to subdue my ego.+LudomirHannah Rachel Werbermacher, the Maid of LudomirA remarkable woman, a teacher of the Hasidim (who listened to her teaching through a half-open door, so as to preserve distance, and perhaps preserve a fiction that they were not in fact being taught by a woman), whose insight gave her access to the other side, or the many other sides, of stories being considered.God is present, even in the midst of evil.+MezritchDov Baer, the Maggid of MezritchThe word Maggid means 'storyteller'. Through the stories, here the key is self-reflection, to find meaning in the innermost being, to find that still, small voice that can only speak in silence and the absence of our own activity.God was here because I stopped being aware of myself.+NachmaniShmuel bar MachmaniWho was Jacob, and why should he know this? Who is God, and why should God do this? These are questions that are historical as much as theological or psychological, and it is in our history and God's history that we find meaning and identity.I could have climbed this ladder of history.+De LeonMoses ben Shem Tov de LeonA remarkable book, lost for a time, whose existence was denied even by Moses de Leon's widow, the Zohar, gives astonishing insight into the interior of God, reality, and our selves, and how to find a deep connection that is always present and never finished. Attributed to another author, Shimon bar Yohai, Kushner speculates that perhaps they shared the same soul. The completeness of the self of the universe connects through Jacob's story here.I is the Lord your God+OstropolShimshon ben Pesach OstropolerBeyond the question and awareness of the self of God and the self of the universe is the self, basic and simple, complex and intricate. Rabbi Shimshon put names to the kelipot, the broken shards of creation. We are all a part of a whole, a broken piece in and of ourselves. Our awareness of this helps begin the process of reunion.I didn't know that my name was part of God's nameEach interpreter's chapter stands on its own merits, but each is connected to the other, and to a wider body of interpretation and scholarship, by the use of side notes and references done in (what I would describe as being) a proto-talmudic structure. The Talmud has been described by some as one of the world's first hypertexts, with cross-links and chains that lead through the text -- this book does similar linking.Rabbi Kushner concludes by linking all the stories to the reader:`Each person has a Torah, unique to that person, his or her innermost teaching. Some seem to know their Torahs very early in life and speak and sing them in a myriad of ways. Others spend their whole lives stammering, shaping and rehearsing them. Some are long, some are short. Some are intricate and poetic, others are only a few words, and still others can only be spoken through gesture and example. But every soul has a Torah.'The relative place of self (both as an I and as an i) in God's life and universe becomes more apparent through these stories. Human beings are important, yet who can be important in relation to God? Yet, who is not important in relation to God? May this work help you discern where God is in your life, and what you are called to be."	R
"God was in this place & I	"God was in this place & I, i did not know: Finding self, spirituality, and ultimate meaning",,A3PJFOIP93JGPE,"Steven Marks ""Prog Harpo""",17/18,5.0,995155200,The hand of God,"As you have gathered from the main review, this book focuses on the meaning of just one verse in Genesis, when Jacob awoke from the ladder dream. Usually Rabbis pick up on a verse just a couple verses back where &quot;the Angels of God were going up and down the ladder&quot;. The focus is that they start on Earth and go to Heaven - not the other way around.This book is great because it is like there is a dialog accross the space-time continuumn with 7 Rabbis in different locations and centuries arguing about their 7 different interpretations.One interpretation based on the fact that there are two &quot;I's&quot; in the verse spelled differently in Hebrew. It is that my Godlike &quot;I&quot; did not know God was present because my ego &quot;i&quot; was in the way. Jacob's chance to experience God was diminished because the ego &quot;i&quot; was ragiling off its commentary. This concept is similar to Buddism.Kushner adds an 8th interpretaion in his prolouge - which I won't spoil by going into detail. I heard Kushner talk at a Synagouge in Austin, Texas and he summarized his interpretation by finishing, &quot;Hold up your hands before your eyes. You are looking at the hands of God.&quot;A great book on modern Jewish mystism."	R
"God was in this place & I	"God was in this place & I, i did not know: Finding self, spirituality, and ultimate meaning",,A2MHUSO8C0XO23,J. Miller,13/13,5.0,1144368000,Poetic and Intelligent,"Kushner walks us through the exegetical vantage points of seven different rabbis, each looking at the same text. Jacob awakes from a dream about a ladder (Gen 28:16), and declares that he has experienced God. Kushner then poetically imagines the seven rabbis ascending and descending the ladder to teach us how to read the text. What results is a beautifully poetic look at the biblical text itself, a clever mode of teaching us Jewish history and midrash, and a fully postmodern system of acknowledging the existence of multiple perspectives. As with Kushner's other works (cf. Jewish Spirituality) it evolves into a mystical climax in which the reader and text are equated.The seven are:1. Rashi (Rabbi Shelomo ben Yitzhaki, @1050). He calls us to focus on the literal text without distraction, without background noise. He says that the real miracle of the burning bush required Moses to pay attention for more than a minute to realize that it was not burning (p. 24).2. Kotzk (Menachem Mendl of Kotzk, 1787-1859). He said that we needed to destroy our egos and should begin by calling ourselves liars (p. 38, 54). We should do this through gemilut hasidim, acts of selflessness (p. 51). Kotzk later in life condemned himself to solitude, only occasionally stepping onto his balcony to yell into the crowd, ""You are all liars!""3. Ludomir (Hannah Rachel Werbermacher, 1805-1892). The only woman on the list, she called us to see that God was there even in the midst of evil. Teaching men through a half open door (p. 58), she taught them that God does not intervene in human affairs without human agency (p. 62). In fact, we are to assume that the fall in the garden was an act of God. God was present with Jacob in the angel that wrestled with him.4. Mezritch (Dov baer of Mezritch, d. 1772). He says that the goal of the religious life is devekut, cleaving to God (p. 84). Forced to follow a monk whose job it is to wash dishes (p. 87), he discovers that the purpose of life is to escape self-reflection to throw one's self whole-heartedly into one's role. Otherwise, as in a game of racquetball (p. 89), the self is always distracted when it focuses on anything other than its purpose. The self then becomes fragmented, with one part looking back at the rest to analyze its existence. ""Too much concentration can be worse than none at all"" (p. 90). We should be like the husband whose quest it is to find the right food for the pregnant wife in the middle of the night (p. 103). The ""I did not know"" of the Genesis text really refers to not paying attention to the ""I.""5. Nachmani (Samuel bar Nachmani, late 3rd c.). He sees in the story the issue of Jacob needing to become part of history, to take hold of history and enter into it.6. De Leon (Moses be Shem Tov de Leon, 1240-1305). De Leon wrote out a book called the Zohar (p. 130), and though he attributed it to a long-dead rabbi, he seems to have produced it himself. He says that the we are to accept who we are and put aside the veil of deceptive pseudo-identities. God's primary activity is to free us from the slavery to those self-deceptions. If God had a business card, the subline would read, ""Frees slaves,"" and then ""Call anytime"" (p. 144). God is the sense of self, the ""I,"" the Anochi, which is free.7. Ostropol (Shimson ben Pesach Ostropoler, d. 1648). He would say that it should be read, ""God was in this place and I did not know it was i."" We are somehow an indispensable part of God (p. 173). To look at your own hands is to look at the hands of God (p. 174). Somehow Abraham's father Terah was redeemed by the activities of Abraham himself. There is an old legend of Abraham smashing Terah's idols, and the conclusion is that the idolatries are redeemed by the son who is a part of him.The conclusion is that the text can be read legitimately through multiple lenses, and as we do so, our eyes are increasingly opened by and to the text. God may speak in any number of ways through our interaction with the text.It's a brilliant book, unlike most, both poetic and intelligent."	R

The chapter on De Leon - Rabbi Luria - which presents the 10 commandments as a circular system, offers unique insight.Rabbi Kushner's longing for the Messiah, which is so evident in his writing has added much to my understanding of my own faith.Rabbi Kushner's liberal use of story to explain on many levels that which is difficult to explain at all sheds a new light on the ""parables"" of JesusI eagerly seek out any word of a new book.

The soul of man under socialism	The soul of man under socialism,,A1AWIMIVWGIER,Dana Garrett,2/4,3.0,1338249600,Oscar Wilde: Theory on a Holiday,"Oscar Wilde's The Soul of Man under Socialism depicts the tangential and unintended callousness of socialistic thinking when it is merely theoretical and future-based and is not also activist, revolutionary and focused on the present.Wilde understands perfectly well that one of the principal goals of socialism is the elimination of poverty: ""The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible."" That might be the aim, but what should be done in the meantime to alleviate the suffering of the poor? In a word, the answer for Wilde is ""nothing."" He argues that charitable attempts to help the poor both fail to help the poor but also ""prolong"" the disease that cause poverty. The disease, of course, is the system of capitalistic exploitation. It is wrongheaded, Wilde argues, to use the fruits of capitalism to redress the consequences of its rampages: ""It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property. It is both immoral and unfair."" While Wilde is confident that the ravages of poverty will cease in a future socialistic society, he opposes all palliatives for the poor and oppressed in the meantime. That is one of the consequences of confining socialistic thought to merely theoretical and future-based considerations and failing to also make it activist, revolutionary and focused on the present.Wilde's socialism of ""voluntary association"" of the future is individualistic (individuals should be free to choose their own work), anti-authoritarian, and government-less (largely anarchical). In fact, Wilde sees authoritarian socialism as constituting a worse state of affairs than capitalistic exploitation: ""If the Socialism is Authoritarian; if there are Governments armed with economic power as they are now with political power; if, in a word, we are to have Industrial Tyrannies, then the last state of man will be worse than the first.""Wilde extols the prospects of an anti-authoritarian socialistic society because of its potential to actualize individuality. But Wilde's individualism has a kind of hierarchy about it--one, it is impossible to fail to notice, that leaves persons like himself at the top: ""These are the poets, the philosophers, the men of science, the men of culture--in a word, the real men, the men who have realised themselves, and in whom all Humanity gains a partial realisation."" Apparently, those given to other vocations are not quite as ""real"" and can only partially realize these Olympian heights.Soon Wilde's discussion of individualism acts as an unstable catalyst, causing him to veer into a wide variety of topics often inexplicably. But the topics that preoccupy him for most of the work are aesthetic and literary concerns, especially as they relate to the relationship between individualism and artistic expression. While this discussion has some merit and interest, it is difficult to imagine why these peevish considerations require the lengthy treatment they receive in a work entitled ""The Soul of Man under Socialism.""My reservations about Wilde's work notwithstanding, I do think this is a relatively important work to read. While the work as a whole lacks a coherence that could have made it more effective, many individual passages are keenly insightful and highly quotable."	R

Capital ""I"" on individualist.I couldn't find a date for this writing, but I believe his legal problems and the rumors preceding his legal problems were actually the motivation, and not economics or politics.As many artists and I consider myself one, believe their work and their life are one. Oscar showed his colors as far as common people go. I could not imagine him an equal to a chimney sweep or a waiter.Oscar was hurt and he was attempting to argue that life style, and art, especially his, should be free from the common people's rules.

They wave goodbye.Then all the rest of it is just Little Critter messing things up or having suggestions that aren't great (such as sucking up the curtain vacuuming, knocking over a vase dusting, spilling the paint, using too much toothpaste or dish soap, wanting to buy all junk food at the store, etc.)It really feels like this is so similliar or much more suited to the Little Critter I Just Forgot book or Little Critter Visiting Grandma and Grandpa. It has very little to do with getting your child ready to be away from mom and dad should they be going on a short trip so the book fails in what it appears to be trying to do based on the title. Most other Little Critter books do a great job of telling a story that covers some kind of kid issue or fear, this one just doesn't address the issue of the title and is dissapointing."	R

I became a fan of Christine Feehan only a few months ago and I hope she continues to write often as I have enjoyed all of her novels so far. This story was very enjoyable and interesting. I enjoyed the interaction between the two main characters and also some of the secondary characters, especially the children. It was a little predicatable, but there is still a quality in Christine Feehan's writing that grabs you and keeps you interested... and wishing that it had not ended!The only compliants I have is that one of the brothers characters was undeveloped to the point that it did not make sense, as well as the &quot;special gifts&quot; that both the main characters had. The authors seemed to imply some power beyond ESP, but yet never expanded or provided any sort of explanation for these &quot;gifts&quot;.I am really looking forward to the next novel. I hope it will be a continuation (perhaps the Don's brother?) of this story. I am also still hoping for more vampire romances as well!"	R

This is a true gothic with just enough paranormal elements to help build a relationship between the hero and heroine.

He has &quot;gifts&quot; of his own. Nicoletta isn't immediately enchanted with the idea of marriage to the Don. Unlike some authors, who use the &quot;I hate you!&quot; temper tantrum to ignite passion between the main characters, Ms. Feehan uses the empathy and sensitivity of her characters to achieve it. The love scenes are wonderful, though not very plentiful. So if you're looking for the same amount and intensity of love scenes as in the Dark books, you may be dissappointed.

I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love, in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine's point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the &quot;dark&quot; series, you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book, you're kept in suspense of who was the bad guy, if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan, if your reading, please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!"

It doesn't have Vampires or Carpathiansin it but the lack of those doesn't diminish this book one bit. This is the story of the village healer, a beautiful girl names Nicoletta and the Fierce, dark and cursed Don Giovanni Scarletti.

Together they must fight the evil that is threatening to kill them both and over come the Curse. There is many instances of humor and I found myself wanting to read more after the book was done.

The story centers around the curse on the Scarletti's, where the women they love end up dead, and where most women who come to the Palazzo Scarletti die, including Nicoletta's mother and aunt. Nicoletta (a healer), herself, is chosen via bride contract by the Don Scarletti (a Telepath), and the story developed from there, with many twists and turns. The characters were well developed and the story line kept you guessing until the end. I was so hooked that I finished it in one night, the same night I got it through the mail.Christine has done it again. I picked up the &quot;Scarletti Curse&quot;, uncertain on what I would find. On one hand, she has been consistent in writing books with great character development and great story lines in her &quot;Dark&quot; series about the Carpathians. On the other, this was a non-Carpathian book, though a Gothic, so I did not know whether she could make the transition. She made the transition extremely well and created another keeper for my keeper shelf.Christine has proven that she can write differently and Scarletti Curse was refreshingly interesting. I am anticipating and hoping that she will expand this into a series. (Spoiler here: Christine has hinted that Nicoletta and Giovanni have some relation to her Carpathian series. I look forward to her exploring that in more detail)I really hope that Christine explores Antonello's character. He was a secondary character and very mysterious, the only character that Christine did not explore in depth. He quite fascinated me. I would also like to see some explanation as to where Giovanni and Antonello got their telepathic abilities.Thank you, Christine!

True, it had a lot more sex than Victoria Holt or other gothic writer favorites ever included in their books, but it didn't take away from my enjoyment.Nicolette is a free spirit with a secret. She was born with the gift of healing and knowing when somebody needed her.The villagers depend on her healing skills and rally around her to keep her hid from outsiders. They know Nicolette could be burned as a witch, otherwise. Don Giovanni, the dark brooding aristocrat, wants Nicolette the first time he sees her. Though his family lives under a curse that all of their women will die, he is determined to make Nicolette his bride.I don't believe in giving too much information in a review so I won't say what happens between them. The book is very atmospheric with the castle and it's sinister wall carvings, the brothers and grandfather who have all lost their wives, and last but not least, the hero with his own gift. One thing I liked about the hero is he was arrogant, but not overly so. He had a soft, gentle side that overshadowed his arrogance, at least to me. I hate heros who are overly arrogant simply because they are men.This was my first book by this author and I am looking forward to reading Dark Prince, another book I have by her."	R

Christine's style and gift for writing wonderful heroes and heroines along with a fascinating story is not lost. Nicoletta is a strong, compassionate, courageous heroine that learns to make the best of a frightening and seemingly hopeless situation. She is forced into marriage with the mysterious Giovanni Scarletti, who's reputation of darkness and danger strikes fear in the hearts of most in her village. To make matters worse once married she will be forced to live in the cursed Scarletti palazzo secretly nicknamed the &quot;Palazzo Della Morte&quot; where few women who enter manage to escape with their lives. Despite her hesitation she soon discovers there is a powerful attraction between she and Giovanni and seeks to unravel the mystery surrounding her own mother's death in the castle years ago. Is Giovanni the monster her fellow villagers whispered he was or could there be much more to him than she first imagined? Giovanni is just the type of hero I enjoy, like the heroine he is one that can both frighten me yet manage to touch my heart at the same time. The story kept me on the edge of my seat. For fans of the paranormal there is that aspect as well. Nicoletta is gifted with a healing power and Giovanni has the power to speak directly into your mind.

THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a true gothic romance, and people who love gothics--like me--will definitely want to read it.The book has elements that were in Feehan's vampire novels and which will be familiar to that audience: telepathy; a dictatorial hero (the curse of the Scarlettis is that they're supposedly destined to kill the women they love in jealous rages); the heroine with REALLY long hair; destiny. There's also the quintessential gothic palace--poetically called the &quot;Palace della Morte&quot; by the local villagers--with hideous artwork, secret passageways, etc., etc., whose inhabitants all seem to be up to something nefarious.I quickly became completely engrossed in the story. No, it's not terribly original, but I loved every turn in the plot, anyway. The story is told very much from the heroine's point of view, which is appropriate, and all the other characters were well filled-out and suited for their purpose in the book. The reason I'm giving THE SCARLETTI CURSE four stars instead of five, however, is that the book, while enjoyable, did have some problems. For example, the love scenes seemed emotionless and out of place in the novel, which was odd because Feehan usually excells at love scenes. I also thought the explanation for everything happening at the &quot;Palace della Morte&quot; didn't quite make sense.Despite these two things, however, I thoroughly enjoyed THE SCARLETTI CURSE, and I think Christine Feehan has found her niche! I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the work of Ann Radcliffe, Mary Stewart, the Brontes, or even Lisa Jane Smith. Definitely, a good read."	R

My feelings have nothing to do with Ms. Feehan's writing style. I so love Christine's Dark series, I feared that I would inevitably begin to make comparisons and would find this book a major disappointment. It wasn't.There is a terrible curse which plagues the Scarletti men. Every woman who enters the Palazzo as a bride winds up dead. What or . . . whom is causing these fatal accidents?Nicoletta is a healer who possesses &quot;special&quot; gifts. Deep within her being she senses when someone needs her. She is drawn to the great Palazzo knowing that there is a young girl inside who is desperately ill. Once inside those forbidding walls, she encounters Don Giovanni Scarletti known as Il Demonico (The demon).He is dark, brooding and utterly dangerous. Nicoletta instinctively senses the potential threat he poses to her yet she is drawn to him as he is to her. Even the knowledge of his dark and deadly reputation cannot sever the attraction from growing.Don Scarletti also possesses his own &quot;gifts&quot; and chooses her for a bride. What initially begins as a duty for Nicoletta turns into passion than into love. Will Nicoletta suffer the same fate as others have? Or will her unwavering love and ulfaltering courage finally bring an end to the family's deadly curse?You have to read the book in order to find out those answers and more. Enjoy!"	R
The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow)	The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),,A3APPKALUGB2GT,Michelle888,8/8,3.0,1121299200,Has enough mystery to keep you reading,"For many years, the Scarletti family history has been shrouded in curses and dark mysteries. Whispers of evil, murder and insanity have been going around the villagers about the family that rules their lands. They say that no bride has ever survived in the palazzo, and considering the number of women who have met their untimely death in what everyone has come to refer to as the Palazzo Della Morte (Palace of Death), it seemed that the curse is true.Unbeknown to the villagers, the current don has set his eyes on their healer, Nicoletta, the woman whose identity they have protected for fear that she will be branded a witch by those who might misinterpret her gift of healing. So how did Don Giovanni Scarletti find out about their beloved Nicoletta when no one has spoken of her to outsiders? Could the rumor be true then that he has powers because he is in league with the devil?THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a dark and mysterious novel filled with suspense and sensuality. Nicoletta is a very likable heroine, with her wit and exuberance. I loved the way she seemed to embrace life with such open arms. Her compassionate nature and youthful innocence is quite endearing. Giovanni's character is such a mystery. The way he treats Nicoletta with such tenderness is such a contrast from how people perceived him to be.I must say though that even though the author has done well in describing the atmosphere within the palazzo, including the design and architecture lending to the eeriness of the story, there were some parts that dragged a bit. I also didn't care much about the political intrigue, and thought that it wasn't blended in well with the story. I might have understood it more had the author bothered to actually tell us which date the story was meant to have happened (I'm only guessing 15th or 16th century). I know this seems trivial, but when I'm reading a historical novel, I do like to know what period it's supposed to be.Overall, this wasn't a bad book. I did enjoy the banter between the don and his barefoot bride. You can read about Giovanni and Nicoletta's descendant, Antonietta Scarletti, in Dark Symphony (which I'm reading at the moment)."	R

Before I reached halfway I really didn't care about the characters. The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional.

They keep this charade to prevent the people at the palazzo knowing about Nicoletta's extraordinary healing powers (this heritage is explained in the Carpathian book ""Dark Symphony, in which the lifemate is a descendant of the main characters/couple). As Maria Pia is a midwife herself this causes no problem.At the palazzo the patients turned out to be Don Giovanni Scarletti and his niece Sofia, suffering from food poisoning. While both ""healer"" and assistant do their work, Don Scarletti keeps observing Nicoletta, asking her questions when Maria Pia fell asleep and after many dissatisfying non-answers says ""I am not so blind as you and the healer seem to think""!A few days later the ""healer"" and assistant were summoned to the palazzo again, but this time Nicoletta knows that no one is ill. Maria Pia therefore went back to the Palazzo with another assistant, but this assistant is old and when asked about Nicoletta kept telling the Don how wonderful and extraordinary she really is. This gives Don Giovanni a reason to choose a bride at The Bridal Convent. His choice is Nicoletta, who gets escorted (begging and struggling) back to the palazzo by the Don.In the following days up to and after the wedding arguments heat up, a few murders commited, the staff gossip, while Nicoletta grows into the role of the Lady of the Palazzo."

I was looking forward to the Scarleti novel as well. I was suprised at her change of writting style. I kept thinking I was reading a Ann Rice wanta be. The characters are now well drawn, Nicolette is weak, scared and is not consitant with her personality. We do not get to know what makes Giovanni &quot;tick&quot; he is not well drawn and what motivates him. Feehan spent so much time trying to make the castle a dark scarry place that it was overkill. Nicolette the villiage healer is picked as the bride for the local and powerful Don Giovanni,who is cursed, after she heals his neice. He persues her and seems to speak to her with special powers that scare her, even though she has her own special healing powers. Nicolette goes from being a superstitious weak scardy cat, to not caring at all and doing as she pleases. Giovanni pushes the wedding ahead, not wanting to wait to take her. He goes from extremely controlling to being very caring and gentle. Giovanni does not care that he takes her from what she loves, or what is important to Nicolette as long as she does what he tells her to do. Nicolette finally figures out that the family &quot;curse&quot; for the Scarlettis is from a family member and frees Giovanni from the curse. I do not recommend the book, it was a disappointment to me. The writter spent to much time using words to describe the landscape and the buildings and the rooms and I don't remember what all else, and she did not develope her characters."	R

Christine Feehan has put these elements in play in such exciting ways in her Dark series that she's raised the bar incredibly for Paranormal romance. It's hard to picture anyone writing about noble vampire-like creatures in a more exciting, sensuous, just flat out stunning way. This book, though not about the vampire-like beings in her others, adds an exciting Gothic twist to Christine's writing, and a clever mystery to her incredibly involving characterizations. The suspenseful ending is very exciting, and the reader is not sure until the end how the book will resolve.

Nothing, not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went, once again, off on a tagent.

The heroine is a healer but in a time where she could be burned at the stake should this secret gift be discovered. In order to protect herself, she pretends to be a healers apprentice. Unfortunately, the one man she wishes to hide this talent from, Giovanni Scarletti, is not fooled.Like much of Feehan's work, the story is very gothic in feel and the villain(s) are truly horrible. While the hero is constantly swooping in and saving the heroine, it becomes more of a joke between the two of them than a tiresome what-a-stupid-girl scenario.I was leary of this novel after being dissappointed with &quot;Lair of the Lion.&quot; This novel is much, much better.

They all violently die. One of the villagers Nicoletta knows first hand that her own mother was a victim of the curse. Still, she lives life to the fullest and uses her abilities to heal people. Her guardian helps hide the secret that Nicoletta has empathic talents by fostering the idea she is just the village healer to keep her safe from Giovanni Scarletti.However, the kind Nicoletta helps cure ailing lass, suffering from dining on a contaminated meal with her uncle Giovanni. He immediately realizes that Nicoletta is his life mate and will protect her from his enemies, but will his need to keep her safe end up making him follow the footsteps of his ancestors who loved so deep they killed for love?Though there is a political sidebar that adds suspense to the tale, this gothic story line belongs to the two lead characters. Nicoletta is the classic heroine willing to do the right thing even at the cost of her own life. Giovanni is the dark brooding alpha male wanting to also do the right thing for his people and especially his beloved. Toss on top of the key theme a bit of the paranormal and readers have Christine Feehan's intrepid venture outside the Carpathian realm (see her ""Dark"" series) into a totally different sub-genre that proves she is a versatile talent who deserves a wide readership.Harriet Klausner"	R

Penn ""WordWeaving""",5/5,5.0,987206400,Gothic danger and passionate love -- Very highly recommended,"The ancient dons worshipped the old gods, honoring their pagan heritage and building the palazzo in defiance of the Holy Church. Two centuries ago the Scarletti family was cursed, and now for years there have been rumors of murders and assignations. Indeed, the palazzo itself feels evil to sensitive Nicoletta, a woman who is known to be &quot;different&quot; in her gifts to heal, to listen to the wind, to sense danger. So when the mesmerizing Don Scarletti chooses her to be his bride, Nicoletta knows every bride who entered the palazzo is doomed.Nicoletta roamed the hills surrounding her village before the don's choice of her curtailed her activities to the palazzo. She had sworn no man would command her, but when she fled her home to hide, the don followed her, luring her with his own gift. The don's darkly sensual voice, erotic and seductive, entices her imagination and her womanhood, linking her to the man she would flee.Don Scarletti knows well the dangers that lurk upon his land. Political upheaval and family secrets threaten the woman he takes as wife, as well as the others dependent upon him. He carefully guards his own gifts from others than his chosen bride. Only Nicoletta can reach through his icy aloofness to the passionate man concealed within.As a new comer to Christine Feehan's work, I had very high expectations based on other reader's reactions, and I am not disappointed. Written with a sensuous style, a deep understanding for history, and a respect for both Christianity and Paganism, THE SCARLETTI CURSE contains a fast paced plot and dynamic characterizations. All the classic gothic elements keep the pages turning, including the dark castle with gargoyles, warnings from natural elements, portents from ravens, secret passageways, family secrets, and multiple dead wives. Further, the strong heroine isn't too perfect; the troubled hero still maintains his strength amid his human failings, while the gothic elements lend the perfect depth and shadow.

The plot was good, the hero and heroine were a good match, but I could not get past all the breaks in the sentences to inclue a couple of Italian words. It seemed that Ms. Feehan tried too hard to add that touch of Italian to every other sentence by putting in the two Italian words for my bother, my mother, my father, my grandfather, my grandmother. It was down right annoying to keep reading these few sets of words so frequently. It was very hard to keep the pace of reading the book when the sentences were broken up so often with the Italian. I have been a romance reading for over 20 years and have frequetnly read romance with touches of another language thrown in here and there, but this one was just to choppy for me to enjoy.

Obviously this book is part of the required reading. It is a 'standard' work by which I mean that it and a few others are considered to be baseline, required reading for anyone who wishes to advance beyond the elementary level in the field of hermeneutics.That said, I give it four stars because it is definitely not accessible by everyone. It is written for people who have a serious goal in mind and a disciplined study habit. It is not ""easy reading"" though it is well worth the effort. Further it is much more beneficial to those who have at least a working knowledge of Biblical Hebrew & Greek. In my class there are those who are entry level students (or auditors) who do not meet these criteria and I require them to read Berkhof but I augment the course with other books (""Reading the Bible With Heart & Mind"" by T. Longman, for one). This helps them advance with what they can get from Berkhof and reminds the more advanced students of their need to remain devotional in their Bible studies also.All in all, highly recommended for any reader as long as they understand what they are getting. You will be introduced to the various historical approaches to Biblical Interpretation (there are more than one you know), a sketch of a critique for each and a solid outline of how to build a more carefully crafted understanding of what the Bible teaches in your own reading."

That said, I think what is said here would be sufficient for many people to come to terms with the core principles.At the end of many of the sections in the book are a list of references to other books and a set of questions. The questions seem to be based on the other works referenced, but I haven't been able to check as I don't have access to any of the cited works. Unfortunatly, due to the age of this text, many of the cited works are not longer in print.Many of the questions later on in the book are require you to apply the techniques covered to particular verses; no answers are provided, so it'd be useful for you to have someone who you can ask to check your answers."

Then experience had become my mentor, wiping its feet on that pristine part of myself that was idealistic and analytical. It is disheartening when a thinking person is forced to admit that many cliches are true. There is no justice on this earth. Nothing would ever undo what Ronnie Joe Waddell had done."" (p. 6)Scarpetta is a the medical examiner and Waddell, recently executed inmate, is her latest case. The Waddell case won't be so easy, and it turns out his prints are showing up at crimes during and after his execution. Was the wrong person executed? Waddell's prints are in ""the system"". Speaking of systems, who broke into Scarpetta's computer? And why are her two employees, Ben and Susan, acting strangely? On top of this, Scarpetta has to ""babysit"" her sidekick and her niece. Her sidekick, Pete Marino, is a cop who can't get over the end of his marriage. With bad health habits and a sour disposition, Scarpetta has to constantly remind Marino to watch out for himself. And her niece, Lucy, has gone from being a fat little kid to a thin, super intelligent math and science whiz. Lucy is now a bratty 17- year old with a terrible attitude. But hey, she can help Scarpetta with the computer, so it's worth having Lucy around! (I think Lucy is supposed to be annoying- it makes her more realistic.)So, it appears Scarpetta has to figure out why Waddell's prints are appearing at new crimes and why other people are being murdered. Simple enough, right? Yes, but it doesn't stay simple. Cornwell makes the plot extremely hole-ridden with little sidetracks. Scarpetta's missing her lover, Mark James. She's trying to make amends with flakey morgue attendant Susan Story. Professionally, Scarpetta's in A LOT of trouble, and the government nor the media will give her space. She also has to deal with the families of the deceased, who move in and out of the story, sometimes reappearing, and sometimes disappearing into thin air. These details bog down what could be an excellent thriller.What I do like - the vivid descriptions of Virginia winters. Completely spot on, and it makes me look forward to a break in my current sticky, summer weather. :)The medical procedures are described in detail - electric chair executions, autopsies, fatal gun shot wounds, etc.Again, though, Cornwell does ""too much of a good thing"" by getting overly technical with the description of Robyn Naismith's/Sam Potter's residence. As for the mysterious feathers, again, too much detail is given to the what, where, why and how's of orinthology. Too many pages devoted to the types of feathers in down. Bo-ring!This is an average read. I am not encouraging you to run to your local bookstore, because it would be a total waste of money. When you have time, and space on your library card account, check out this book. BUT, do not make it your first Scarpetta novel, because it will turn you away from the series!"	R

Jin,0/0,3.0,1273795200,"Excellent first half, unfocussed and over-the-top second half","'Cruel And Unusual' won Patricia Cornwell the CWA's Gold Dagger award, suggesting that those in the know regard it as her best Scarpetta book. I'm not so sure. The first half is excellent, raising the baffling and unsettling prospect of a killer committing murders from Beyond The Grave. But I feel the book badly loses focus in the second half, resulting in a rushed and somewhat anti-climactic conclusion.Note that this book sets up a story thread through the next two books, so you must read this before tackling 'The Body Farm' and 'From Potters Field'.To the story itself: convicted murderer Ronnie Waddell has just been executed. But when a young boy is found murdered in a strikingly similar fashion, Scarpetta, Marino and Wesley are forced to consider a number of disturbing possibilites. Is there a copycat killer? Or was the wrong man sentenced to the chair? This part of the book is well written, with a strong focus on the forensic science, as well as a study of Waddell himself and the crime he allegedly committed. But when another ""copycat"" killing turns up Waddell's fingerprint, things take a very bizzare twist.Here is where the book loses me. Instead of considering more logical possibilities about how a dead man's fingerprint might have got somewhere, Scarpetta and Co jump to the most extraordinary conclusion. The idea that Waddell could (a) convince another person to go to the chair for him, and (b) organise smuggling the imposter in and himself out, is ridiculous. Also, the latter part of the book is increasingly taken up with an investigation into Scarpetta herself, dragging her into court on the flimsiest of ""evidence"". Cornwell really lets her poor-woman-persecuted-by-evil-sexist-men theme go over the top here. Arrogant oaf Patterson may be, but to pin a multiple murder on Scarpetta? It's silly.The end result is that the conclusion to the book is incredibly rushed. It literally takes place within the last few pages, and is based on little more than a sudden hunch from Scarpetta. Combined with the fact that the finale is deliberately open-ended, the whole thing comes across as a huge anti-climax. While it does provide the perfect lead-in to 'The Body Farm', as a stand-alone ending I can only remember how cheated I felt when I first read the book.So in all, a great beginning that's let down by a confused and unfocussed conclusion. The central plot is clever and the investigation is interesting, but it's disappointing Cornwell seems to lose the thread of the story badly in the second half.[3.5 stars]."	R

It was great to backtrack and discover what has become one of my favorite books in the series. The story is SO imaginative and original! The suspense is taut and kept me on the edge of my seat. And most of all, there is Kay, a three dimensional, refreshingly human heroine. No, she isn't perfect. As the possibility of an affair with a married man arose, I wasn't &quot;appalled&quot; by Kay, I was heartbroken for her. Driven by work, shattered by lost love, reaching for someone to bring her back to life emotionally ... her feelings may not be noble but they certainly seemed human to me. A powerful woman in a controversial, conventionally male field, and reviewers ask why so many people hate her? It seems very realistic that the head of a high-profile state agency would find herself with enemies. While I have no real criticism of this book, I do have a comment on the rest of the series. Part of why I enjoyed this one so much is Lucy. As the series progresses, Lucy's life gets so complicated and convulated and dangerous that it is her character, not Kay's, that strains credibility.

After a decade of appeals, Ronnie Joe Waddell is finally being executed and Scarpetta waits to perform the autopsy (though I'm not clear why that should be necessary). But that same evening, a young boy is ritually murdered in a manner very reminiscent of Waddell's style. That's followed by another murder -- and Waddell's fingerprints apparently are found on the scene. Was someone else executed in his place? The authorities involved, of course, don't even want to *think* about such an appalling possibility. More murders follow, including Scarpetta's own Morgue Attendant, and suddenly links seem to be turning up to tie the Chief Medical Examiner to the killings, as well as to corruption in her own office. All the action takes place in the few weeks preceding and following the Christmas-New Year's holidays, and the gray, cold winter adds greatly to the flavor of the narration.There's no question that this one is an improvement over the first one I read. Cornwell doesn't bring in a completely new character in the last chapter to be the villain, for one thing. And she has added considerable depth to the personalities of all the repeating characters, especially Lt. Pete Marino of Richmond Homicide and FBI Special Agent Benton Wesley. My favorite, though, is Lucy, Scarpetta's niece from Miami, who possesses what another character calls a &quot;frightening intellect.&quot; But she's still seventeen years old, and her home life is, in many ways, not a happy one. Aunt Kay really does try to be the friend and confident to Lucy that she would like to be, but she has her own emotional problems -- not least among them the death of her lover in an IRA bombing in London less than a year before -- and her naturally reserved and somewhat stony personality is sometimes her own worst liability.There are problems, though. Cornwell has a rather pompous style, especially when she's describing the latest crime-fighting technological advances, or the ins and outs of UNIX. It's as if she enjoys saying &quot;I know more about this than you do.&quot; She also indulges in irritating word-choices, such as not knowing the difference between &quot;in&quot; and &quot;inside&quot; (e.g., &quot;I put my revolver inside my purse&quot;), and she seems to be unaware of the use of contractions in ordinary speech. Still, the well thought out plot and the complications in possible motives and interpretations kept me reading. Many fans and reviewers take it as a given that Cornwell is the &quot;best&quot; mystery writer working, which I can't agree with at all. But she's not bad."	R

In that sense it was a really good read and delivered the suspense it promised. I usually enjoy Patricia's books and like the way she builds a profile of her heroine's life, including the people she is close to as well as those more on the periphery of her life - it helps the reader to relate to her and treat her as a real person. I particularly like the way she combines her professional life with her personal one and think it shows the human side which is very necessary considering her profession which could otherwise seem very detached and clinical so well done for that consideration. The plot was complex but not too much so and very cleverly thought out. The only reason I didn't find it unputdownable was because for me the over usage of technical jargon got in the way too much. Most people not familiar with the terminology will probably find it irritating - after all, who wants to have to refer to a medical directory to understand what's being said!

At least, she thinks it's his body. On the same day of Waddell's execution, another murder occurs--this one eerily similar to the one committed nine years ago. When the killer strikes again--this time, murdering one of Scarpetta's morgue assistants--Scarpetta quickly finds herself accused of committing the crime herself. Is it a copycat killer? Or has Waddell escaped his punishment? The plot is complex, and this works both for and against the book. The story sometimes so bizarre, so complex, that the reader can't help but keep turning the pages. On the other hand, the plot is so convoluted that the reader may lose track of what's going on. Although readers may agree that everything fits together in the end, they may still be feeling a little confused. In addition to this, Cornwell throws several plot elements at the reader that take the reader completely by surprise--and not in a good way. For example, Scarpetta is in the middle of the investigation when she suddenly recalls that a significant love interest has been killed in a terrorist attack several months before the story actually begins. This is certainly news to any reader who has read this book's predecessor, All That Remains, which concludes with the love interest still very much alive. So much is happening between the books that it just doesn't seem fair to the reader, not to mention sloppiness on the author's part. Cornwell would have done better to give the love story subplot more attention in the story, since it later plays a vital role in Scarpetta's exoneration.

How did she quit smoking (being an ex-smoker myself - I would be interested in reading the withdrawal symptoms of a medical examiner)?

As such she has the nasty job of processing the remains of murderer Ronnie Waddell, electrocuted after ten years of incarceration. The next day she has another body on her hands, a young man, Eddie Heath, dumped in the street strangely mutiliated. The modus operandi of Heath's murder has some suggestive echoes of the killing for which Waddell is executed. And the plot thickens further when a middle-aged fortune-teller turns up dead in her car and a fingerprint found on her furniture is identified as one of Waddell's. Meanwhile all is not well is Dr Scarpetta's office. Someone has been mucking about with the files on her computer and her morgue supervisor, Susan Stevens, is acting very oddly...This is rather good fun, extremely readable stuff. It's the first of Cornwell's books I have read and it leaves me feeling pretty well-disposed to the prospect of reading one or two more. Scarpetta is an interesting heroine, likeable but complicated and Cornwell is an excellent plotter.

Cruel and Unusual is one of the best in the series in my opinion. I say this because Cornwell is at her best when she quietly piles on the tension factor. Cornwell at her worst is when she feels the need to multiply the body count via the worlds evilest serial killer ala James Patterson. Sadly, after 'Cruel and Unusual', Cornwell starts in on several books that just go further and further out on a limb of insanity. Happily for you the reader, if you have not read this book yet, you are in for a very entertaining yarn from Cornwells best period.The plot here is fairly complicated and its hard to describe much of it without giving away some of the earlier surprises. So I will suffice to say that it starts out when Scarpetta is called in to do an autopsy on a recently executed death row inmate. However, it quickly becomes apparent that something is not quite right. A couple of days earlier a young lad had been killed in much the same manner as the death row inmate and soon it looks like the executed man somehow might not have been the right person put to death. Instead the death row guy might be out on the street knocking off victims once again. How did this happen?Also, Scarpetta is dragged into a series of questions to answer when files start to go missing in her office and something or other is amuck.I hope you read this book. If you haven't tried Scrapetta in the past, its best to start with the first in this series, Postmordom."	R

The husband of the murdered woman begins spreading damaging rumors about Scarpetta and a noose of circumstantial evidence is pulled around her. Soon she is trying to solve the murders for her own self-defense as well as just doing her job.

Nelson,0/1,4.0,1133395200,Lots of loose ends.,"I really like both this author and her popular heroine Dr. Kay Scarpetta because of the maturity of the character in addition to the stoicism that is displayed by her cool and collected manner. She is the ultimate professional. This book ""Cruel and Unusual"" is not up to the author's personal standards set in other books such as ""Trace"" which is one of the very best she has written to date.I have spent the past 10 minutes rereading parts of this book and am still confused by the mishmash ending. I don't have a real clue what happened to the bad guys here. Where is the ravening beast convict who was released from prison and resulted in a number of unsolved murders as one example? There is a lot of personal stuff to soften and ""humanize"" the image of Dr. Scarpetta, but even with the snarky neice Lucy with her smart alecky mouth, there is still the steely and distant feel to Dr. Scarpetta. I like that a lot.IMO, the absolute worst thing an author can do to a strong female character is to make her suddenly get ""melting bones"" or those insipid hormonal storms, a la the Nora Roberts style, et al, that stimulate their ""broody"" instincts at the first sight of an acceptable male and the next topic becomes gooey babies and sucky conversations with relatives rather than science and focus and dedication to one's career that makes for a tight, fascinating and worthwhile read.So, with that in mind, this book gets a 4 pointer simply because Ms. Cornwell avoids the ""romance-crime drama"" pitfalls and forges ahead with a decent, albeit patchy and vague story. I am glad that the author has also forged ahead in her craft and her subsequent stories are sooooo much better than this one."	R

Then, after the death of her assistant, Susan Story, Kay becomes implicated in the crime. Can she discover the true killer before she ends up either in jail or dead herself?What I Liked:First off, I enjoyed Cornwell's writing style. She writes with intelligence and detail, brining you into the very scene. The autopsies, the attention to detail (particularly in relation to Eddie and Jennifer), the thorough regard for the scenery all made it very easy to transport myself to Virginia with Dr. Scarpetta.Further, the story was pretty interesting and left you guessing. When I opened the book, I would have had no clue of the outcome, which was surprising (if, in a sense, a little disappointing as well). Several seemingly unrelated people die, but somehow Cornwall is able to tie their deaths in at the very end.My favorite characters included Benton Wesley, Marino, and, of course, Kay. Benton was an intelligent man, kind and someone Kay could turn to. But he almost held an aristocratic air. Marino, on the other hand, was more down to earth. I enjoyed his arguing with Lucy and how the gruff man ended up coming to Christmas to Kay's after all. Finally, I grew fond of Kay. At first, I found her hard to approach, but then I realized that was her personality anyway. As the story progressed, I felt I got more of a handle on who she was and what she wanted. Further, I enjoyed how she paid attention to detail and thought things through logically.What I Did Not Like:Now, this could be due to my taking a month longer than I should have to finish this book, but I felt the story was slow (but not in an obvious ""Will this book ever end?"" fashion). I was plugging along and realized, ""Hm, I'm halfway through and still have no clue how the heck this is going to end"". This is not necessarily bad, but I would certainly not classify this book as one of those racing thrillers that keeps you on the edge of your seat every moment.My biggest complaint has to be the character of Lucy. She is probably the most annoying character in the book. Her selfish, bratty whining made me wish frequently she would go home. Her actual purpose in the book was so small, I have no idea why she was included for most of it! All she did was discover the message left in Kay's computer and that AFIS had been corrupted. I felt that Cornwall was repetitively shoving Lucy away because she was in the way (sending her to ski with Benton's wife, having her left home alone while Kay ran around doing errands, etc.). And I have a hard time believing that a 17 year old could be such a computer brainiac. I think the story would have been much better without her.Lastly, I felt the ending was rather rushed, the story concluding rather hastily in the last 10 pages or so, almost as if Cornwall was being pushed to get the story done and hurriedly threw the last bits together.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Dialogue is relatively tame, considering the genre. A few d***, h***, ba*****, and some wandering appearances of the f-word.Lucy complains about her mother's promiscuity and asks Kay if her aunt will have an affair. Kay's lover is brought up. Marino goes home with a woman after a Christmas party.Finally, three people are killed in the course of this book (well, more if you count Waddell, the death row criminal, and his victim). The autopsies describe the injuries, which can make the squeamish squeam. Also an explosion is described in retrospect.Overall:My first thought at finishing this is ""Ho-hum"". ""Cruel and Unusual"" is not really a bad book. It is well written and fairly interesting. I just felt that parts drug more than they should and really couldn't stand certain nameless (LUCY!) characters. 3 stars.Brought to you by*C.S. Light*"	R

The book is a must-read for those addicted to Cornwell's well-researched suspense novels, since it sets the stage for a showdown in From Potter's Field. But a major plot hole revealed in the first few pages leaves the reader feeling cheated for the remainder of the novel.We enter the story with Scarpetta recovering from the death of a close friend. While this development certainly bodes well for future plot twists, it leaves the reader frustrated with the current one. The few details of the death surface mostly at the end of the story and while we're told of Scarpetta's devastation, we really don't witness it. Seasoned Cornwell fans are accustomed to these shallow depths in characterization but it nonetheless puts a damper on an otherwise entertaining mystery."	R

I have loved all the Scarpetta's, and read them at least twice over, and i still think this is the worst.The plot was very complicated, and it all seemed a bit of a mess. The characters were nothing special, and i this is the only book in which Cornwell manage to bore me with her normally insightful computer terminology. It's too long, and basically i dont think it has any substance. There is a great potential. The idea for the plot is superb, and could well have been one of the best, but somewhere along the line it all slips. I cant put my finger on it, but i just didnt come away from this with the satisfaction i normally get out of a Kay Scarpetta book.Nevertheless this is still a necessary book to read if you intend to read the entire series. It is one of the major turning points. The first book to feature Temple Gault, who would later lead to Carrie Grethen, Newton Joyce, and all the other catastrophic events which culminate in the next turning point of &quot;The Last Precint&quot;. each one has signalled a new era for Patricia Cornwell, and each one has not been quite as good as the others. But The Last Precint was still much better than this. It is, admittedly, very clever, but far too complicated, and im surprised it got the CWA's gold dagger.nevertheless, i have given it two stars purely because it is such a major point in Scarpetta's life.

A death row inmate, Waddle, is executed, but before his body is even cool, murdered corpses start piling up with Waddle's fingerprints found at the scene of the crime. Next thing you know, people are dropping like flies, some of them close to Dr. Kay, and she is publicly implicated in the deaths.Cornwell has written a workably entertaining mystery here. The plot is engaging and bubbling with intrigue, and the writing isn't hampered by too much extraneous detail or incidental goings-ons. There is a subplot with Kay's niece, Lucy, that I found a tad ingratiating and annoying, but for anyone reading the Scarpetta mysteries in order, it is an understandable and rather necessary bit of character development.I do, however, object to Cornwell relegating some of the more serious character development to the back story. I'm talking about the sudden death of Kay's long-time love interest, Mark, (and, to a lesser extent, her decision to quit smoking). These are pretty significant events in Kay's life, and to leave them in the background as part of the story dressing seems at odds with an author who wants us to sympathize with her character.To that end, some of the story ended up either ringing false to me, or just falling flat. For example, there is much made of Kay's financial secrets, which she refers to in connection with embarassment and rage. When the secrets are finally revealed, I found them to be maudlin and a little silly. It baffled me why Kay would take such pains to keep them hidden.Furthermore, I respect Cornwell's decision to keep her novels secured solely in the Holmesian realm of mystery solving, but this means that there is very little action in the book, and a lot of key details are discussed and reviewed over and over again by the characters. It makes for repetitive reading. It also means that the actual discovery of the culprit's identity is never as important as the sleuthing that went into discovering that identity.In other words, if you're looking for closure with this story, you won't get much. Cornwell does a great job of setting up quite a puzzler, and it will keep you guessing. But, much like a magician with an amazing magic trick, once you learn the secret, you're bound to be a little disappointed."	R

This is my fifth Patricia Cornwell book, but definitely is not my favorite. The plot was terrific--the idea of a death row inmate possibly escaping from prison is a frightening concept, especially since Cornwell is always right on the ball when it comes to accuracy of details. As always, the characters are so realistic that the reader often must test himself to remember that they are indeed fictional. This book got a five star rating from me until about halfway when political injustices against the main character intervened. Although this was a good idea for a plot twist, it seemed that Cornwell was digressing from the main idea of the story, taking the reader into another story completely separate from what we read in the beginning. The ending was a disappointment--throughout the story, Cornwell is setting the reader up for the usual great climax where the perpetrator is discovered and captured and all is well--and then, it doesn't happen. In my opinion, it seemed like the ending was written by not Cornwell, but another author who rushed to complete this chapter of Kay Scarpetta's adventures as soon as possible.

The writing itself is good. The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well `fleshed out'.The bad: Other characters are not well `fleshed out'. The plot never fully explains itself. Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes - or is it about Scarpetta - redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her - after developing an anti-social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one? The latter seems to be the path the author choose - leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved. Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed.

I knew it the first time Cornwell told me. To tell -- not show -- me again and again, always in the same exact way, the same conversations, made me roll my eyes with boredom. Plus, the characters were so one-dimensional, I just didn't care.Ultimately, though, you read a mystery novel for the mystery, and I just didn't find it that interesting.

I have read two others (Cause of Death and Black Notice) before this one, but this is my favorite of the three. Cruel and Unusual contains elements found in the other Scarpetta novels (difficult conversations with her mother and sister, major neuroses revolving around her niece, Lucy, internal plots hatched to ruin Scarpetta, and expecting Pete Marino to drop dead from his excesses at any second), but not to the point where I found the repetition annoying. If anything, I want to see more of these familiar characters. The autopsy details seemed less excessive and the pace was quicker.Cruel and Unusual begins with the execution of a rapist/murderer, and the following autopsy of the felon. Shortly thereafter, a string of seemingly unconnected murders erupt around Richmond. Scarpetta finds one common strand - all appear to be committed by the supposedly dead convict.

Gaston de Blondeville (The modern novelists)	Gaston de Blondeville (The modern novelists),,AVRVACFKJ5QMM,"Tyler R. Tichelaar ""Tyler R. Tichelaar, Ph.D....",12/12,5.0,1184112000,Mrs. Radcliffe: First Lady of Historical Fiction,"Valancourt Books' recent publication of Mrs. Radcliffe's Gaston de Blondeville is a publication long overdue. The novel, originally published in 1826, three years after the mistress of the Gothic's death, was actually written by her in 1803, but then suppressed by her from publication. The general belief is that she disowned the novel, thinking it inferior to her other work; literary historians have also claimed that readers agreed and greeted its publication with little enthusiasm. The primary reason usually given for why it is inferior is that it is the only one of Radcliffe's Gothic novels where she chose to use a real ghost rather than explain what appeared to be supernatural occurrences. The general reader, and especially the student of Gothic and historical fiction, should be allowed to judge the matter for himself and now that Valancourt Books has republished Gaston de Blondeville, that decision can be made.Gaston de Blondeville, while admittedly not as full of chills and suspense as The Mysteries of Udolpho or The Italian, is a remarkable novel in Radcliffe's canon. It marks a noted departure from her earlier novels, and in many ways, it displays her growth and restraint as an author. Considering all her previous novels were published between the time she was twenty-five and thirty-three, a remarkably young age for someone to write three of the greatest Gothic novels of all time, as well as a couple inferior ones, it is not surprising that Radcliffe sought to move in a new direction in her work. Gaston de Blondeville was the beginning of her growth in that new direction, and had she written another like it, readers may have had a real treat in an even greater Radcliffe.My only criticism of Valancourt Books' edition of Gaston de Blondeville--which is filled with a superb collection of secondary sources and an impressive scholarly introduction by Frances Chiu to reflect the historical and political influences of the French Revolution upon the novel--is that no attempt is made in these supplementary materials to explain why Radcliffe made this departure from her past use of rational explanations for supposed supernatural occurrences. I believe that departure is the big question that must be answered about this novel, especially since Radcliffe was otherwise striving to be more realistic from a historical standpoint.Despite what is typically said about Gaston de Blondeville by literary historians, the six contemporary reviews provided in this edition are largely favorable. In her introduction, Frances Chiu quotes these reviews to argue that literary critics condemned the novel, but in truth, only one review is solidly negative while the rest express great enthusiasm for a new work by Mrs. Radcliffe. Chiu quotes La Belle Assemblee as saying ""it is without the lofty pretensions of some of Mrs. Radcliffe's earlier productions, and incapable of exciting an equal intenseness of interest"" but Chiu fails to quote what comes directly after: ""it will not in the slightest degree detract from the fame of her"" and ""it will be read with great satisfaction by every reader of taste."" Scots Magazine was pleased that the novel does not include so much of her poetry which is not remarkable at all, and overall feels the novel is an improvement on her earlier work because ""She avoided long particulars of rural scenery, and tedious trackings of the agitated mind, from one terrible or sorrowful imagination to another."" In fact, the only review that is truly negative is the Monthly Review, which does find parts of the work to praise but chiefly objects to its use of the supernatural.Why Radcliffe decided to include supernatural events as a reality has not been given a good explanation. Perhaps she felt the supernatural was more acceptable to the reading public by the earlier nineteenth century, nearly fifteen years after she wrote her first Gothic novel. While she may have been in competition with other Gothic writers, her contemporaries, such as Matthew Lewis in The Monk (1795) and William Godwin in St. Leon (1799), were not beyond using the supernatural as a possibility, so perhaps she need no longer provide rational explanations for supernatural events. Greater study is needed of how the view toward the supernatural changed and became acceptable in literature, especially during this period as the ""Age of Reason"" was replaced by the horrors of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.What I find more remarkable about Gaston de Blondeville than Radcliffe's use of the supernatural is that it is one of the earliest historical fiction novels. Sir Walter Scott is often credited with being the first major writer of historical fiction, but historical fiction certainly has its roots in Gothic novels with their typically medieval settings. The difference between Gothic and historical fiction is the concentration on a much more realistic historical world. The Gothic typically sets its novels in a more vaguely historical period or avoids attention to historic detail. A key component to historical fiction is the depiction of historical events and historical personages in the background of the novel, such as the Battle of Culloden as the background to Scott's Waverley (1814). If that is true, then I would argue that Radcliffe is our first true female historical novelist since Gaston de Blondeville, although not published until 1826, was written in 1803, a full six years before Jane Porter's The Scottish Chiefs (1809), that tremendous novel about Sir William Wallace, and only three years after Godwin's St. Leon (1799) which only really attains historical fiction status due to its including the historical character of Bethlem Gabor in its pages. (Arguments have been made that Clara Reeve is the first female writer of historical fiction, but I don't feel her work is historically detailed enough to merit such a claim). Radcliffe is far more historically detailed than Godwin in her descriptions of the court of Henry III and in the details she provides of that age of chivalry, tournaments, and medieval monasteries. While her novel may not have had the influence on historical fiction that Scott's works did, and therefore, she may not be the mother of historical fiction, not having led to the birth of similar historical works, as she was for Gothic novels, she certainly is the aunt, who has been kept like a skeleton in the closet, while Gaston de Blondeville has been treated as if it were better not to be talked about it, lest it ruin the Mistress of Gothic Literature's good name.I encourage all lovers of Gothic and historical fiction to read Gaston de Blondeville to make up their own minds. I personally find the novel a much more concise, controlled and mature work, and if not as fascinating and suspenseful as her previous works, one that deserves further attention. If Mrs. Radcliffe had written and published a couple more historical novels after Gaston de Blondeville, I have no doubt she would have rivaled Sir Walter Scott for his dominant place as a writer of historical fiction. As always, I commend Valancourt Books for preserving our literary heritage by printing such important and overlooked works of literature.- Tyler R.

Festivities abound, wine flows copiously, and spirits are high as the King and his subjects prepare to celebrate the nuptials of Sir Gaston de Blondeville. But the joyous mood is interrupted when a merchant, Hugh Woodreeve, comes distraught before the King to demand justice. His kinsman, he claims, was murdered, by the very man the King has come to honour -- Gaston de Blondeville!Suspecting a conspiracy against Gaston, yet obliged to hold a trial to determine the truth of the allegations, Henry imprisons Woodreeve in a tower while awaiting a hearing. Meanwhile, sinister forces are at work, represented by an evil abbot, who will stop at nothing to ensure the truth behind Woodreeve's claims is never revealed.As the trial unfolds and the danger mounts for both Woodreeve and Gaston, a mysterious figure will come from beyond the grave to elucidate the horrible mystery!The only one of Radcliffe's novels to feature a real ghost, Gaston de Blondeville was published posthumously in 1826. This edition, the first-ever scholarly edition of the novel, features a new introduction by Frances Chiu, uncoding the novel's long-hidden political, historical, and religious contexts. A wealth of supplementary materials, including excerpts from other primary texts and the complete text of contemporary reviews, is also provided to enhance modern readers' understanding of the novel's themes."

The Rabbi's Cat	The Rabbi's Cat,16.93,A3F7XLGCTTUMWP,John Harpur,2/2,4.0,1137283200,Tremendously entertaining mixture of fable and wisdom,"This is a very entertaining tale of a clever cyncial rabbi's cat on the surface. However, the tale goes much further than exploring the cat's desire to anthropomorphise. It deals with father-daughter relationships, love, obedience, the stiffling influence of tradition, clashes between cultures, etc. It is uniquely influenced by Jewish theological exegesis and rabbinical commentary. Moreso than Will Eisner's work which was a landmark in this area (also on Amazon).I liked the artwork in the main. Panels are loosely framed on the pages which gives a light flow to the narrative. Colours are strong and mediterranean when needs be. I have two reservations however. Firstly, some of the pieces are overdrawn. Too much unnecessary detail in a scene. Text in the speech bubbles is squeezed at times and as a middle aged person with spectacles I found it hard to read on occasion. My reading wuld have been easier if overall frame size was bigger. Secondly, and this is my major reservation, the whole tale is told primarily through language used by the characters rather than through the characters actions. In other words as a graphic novel, I thought it was too wordy. You may well observe, that it is ironic that a graphic novel based around the culture of the 'people of the Book' repeats the textual propensity of much Jewish self-commentary. Eisner, to my mind, has the text-visual balance better defined. However, these are personal aesthetic opinions and shouldn't detract from the overall conceptual achievement which is exemplary."	R

This novel was originally published in France, in three volumes, spread over three years. It's a wonderful book.By the way, Joann is a guy's name, in France. Maybe, it's an old French spelling of John or Jean. According to the book's jacket blurb, Sfar is one of the ""brightest and most talented of the younger generation of French comic artists."" He has written or collaborated on over one hundred books for adults & children. Sfar received the prestigious Jury Award at Angouleme for The Rabbi's Cat.This book will be enlightening for most people & especially for most Jewish-Americans. The three connected stories are about Algerian Jews in the 1930s, in both Algeria & France. My knowledge of this area of Jewish life & history is negligible. IThe cat in this book gains the power of speech by eating & swallowing the family's pet parrot. The cat ends up having theological & philosophical discussions with the Rabbi. The cat wants to study Kabbalah & get Bar Mitzvahed. They debate both Western thought & Jewish thought.Through the cat's eyes we listen in on the discussions of the Rabbi's students. We learn who are studious & who are vain, arrogant & self-important. We see the Rabbi turn to his own Master with his problems; but, through the cat's eyes we see this Master as less knowledgeable than his disciple. We see a Master who spouts foolishness because he knows of his own inferiority.We learn of the anti-Semitism faced by Jews in Algeria from the non-Jewish French settlers. Many of the Jews had been living in Algeria for centuries & had adopted Arab dress, food & customs. These Jews were turned away from French restaurants & other establishments. They usually felt more at home with the native Algerians; yet, always faced an undercurrent of nonacceptance. Even the French-Jewish establishment, centered in Paris, forced the leaders & Rabbis of the Algerian Jewish community to adapt to French ways, customs & speech. If such leaders & Rabbis couldn't pass demeaning grade school exams showing proficiency in French, they would be replaced; even though all native Algerian Jews spoke Hebrew & Arabic which had enabled them to get along quite well for those previous centuries.Through the cat's eyes we see the title Rabbi's struggle for acceptance by the French Jewish establishment. He is a great man in Algeria & is being considered for the post of Chief Rabbi. First he must pass this silly grade school exam. Readers see his agony & self-doubt. We see his complete joy at passing the exam & his own humbleness.We see friendship between himself & his Arab friends. We learn about Algerian Jews who have gone totally native, living like Nomadic warriors in the desert; at home with guns, knives & lions. We learn about the differences between Algerian Jews & French Jews in the pre-WWII period. We learn about street performers & Algerian Jews who must masquerade asArabs to make a living in France; as the French know almost nothing about Jews from Algeria who live like Arabs but are Jews.It's a wonderful book. There is much to learn about love, loyalty, marriage, family, hypocrisy, bravery, humbleness, friendship, loss, merriment, true riches, anti-Semitism and more. All of this is contained within less than 150 pages of a graphic novel, or what the French call, an adult comic book."	R

I've never seen a book that so honestly discusses an insider's ambivalence about his culture, and from such an unusual perspective. Through the eyes of the Rabbi's cat, this graphic novel relates the story of a Rabbi in 1930s Algeria and France. The Rabbi faces many challenges in navigating his 3,500 year old faith and tradition as the modern world encroaches. He has spent much of his life studying the holy books and commentaries, which provide answers to many questions from cosmic theology to everyday existence. However, he continually encounters situations his religious education did not prepare him for--from his (talking) cat's unorthodox ideas about Judaism; to his cat's desire, unprecedented for an animal, to join the Jewish tribe; to a place the Rabbi visits that does not accommodate the pious Jewish way of life. In the end, the Rabbi faces these dilemmas and difficulties with a mind of his own, in contrast to other characters who either capitulate to secularism or withdraw into hard-line and often damaging religiosity. One of the book's themes is that love and dedication, whether to other people or even to a tradition as legalistic as Judaism's, may not always mean strict obedience. In this, the cat, who is willing to dare ""sacrilegious magic"" to try and help his beloved master, is a most compelling narrator. The cat watches with a sympathetic eye as the humans around him live, struggle and at times bend the rules.Although the prose contains many gems, Sfar's drawings leave something to be desired. In particular, the cat pictures mostly fail to capture a real feline's taciturn dignity, otherwordly softness and glowing-eyed, nocturnal mystique. The human facial expressions and body language, however, add subtleties that could not be achieved in other genres. The colorist, Brigitte Findakly, more than compensates for Sfar's shortcomings as an artist. With a bright, earthy palette, Findakly adds flavor to Sfar's Algeria and France, creating an inviting world for the reader to step into. Occasional profanity, sexual scenes and complicated themes may make _The Rabbi's Cat_ unsuitable for some young children; older children and adults should definitely read this fascinating and compelling book!Familiarity with Jewish theology, law and culture will enhance one's appreciation and understanding of _The Rabbi's Cat_. For a background in the book's cultural context, the curious may want to read _Judaism for Dummies_ or its counterparts in the _Idiot's Guide_ series; in addition, _Jews, God and History_ by Max I. Dimont is my favorite overview of Jewish history and would provide an excellent introduction to the historical context of _The Rabbi's Cat_. _Jews, God and History_ reveals that even before modern times, Judaism was almost never static--to the contrary, and like most healthy traditions, it has continually evolved and developed many historical branches as it adapted to its ever changing environment. Sadly, Jews were expelled from most Arab countries as the region's antisemitism increased in the mid-20th century; however, a world that approximates the Rabbi's might still exist in some Sephardic Jewish Modern Orthodox communities that maintain their traditions while accommodating secular culture. Chabad Lubavitch, a branch of basically traditional Judaism that originated in Eastern Europe, is a bit different but is much more open to answering questions and meeting with outsiders, complete with worldwide ""Chabad houses"" for the purpose. A moderate Judaism like the Rabbi's and an irreverent Judaism like his cat's can be found in the more progressive Conservative, Masorti, Reform, Reconstructionist and UK Liberal movements."	R

We can be found in the unlikeliest of places; Cuba, Mexico City, Rio, Mumbai, Dublin (I'm not joking, there are Jews in Ireland).I once boarded with a Jewish family in Strasbourg. Their lives were much different from those of New York Jews; they kept a lower profile, avoided gentiles, and their eating habits were more like those of their neighbors (no bagels, herring, or kugel on their table). British Jews, respectively, make a greater effort to appear ""English"" while avoiding non-Jews. You won't see cockneys eating in Jewish delis (not that I saw any Jewish delis in London aside from Bloom's).The Rabbi's Cat has a very quirky story that's not easy to summarize. A scrawny cat gains the power of speech and engages his master, a Rabbi, in debates.

The Jews have been an important part of French society for years, but with the way things are going now, it may not last.

The rabbi decides to educate him in the way of the Torah, and the cat insists he wants a Bar Mitzvah, and that by cat's age he is well past thirteen.The author cleverly works interesting questions about religion and culture into the story in a charming, humorous and witty way. There is a magic, a tenderness in the story telling. The cat looks a bit devilish in the beginning, but his unique view of things make for interesting narration.

I heard the author speak on NPR and got the book. The book is in the form of a comic strip, each box lovingly illustrated by the author. The pictures are wonderful, particularly of the cat. They are a joy to behold.Even better are the stories, anecdotes taken from the lives of the Jews in North Africa in the thirties. The stories are both very sad and hysterically funny. The cat has a sardonic turn of phrase that had me in stitches. Through the difficult medium of comics, the author has managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and place. Much of the book is given to musings about life, philosophy, love, God and so on. If you like a good discussion, you'll enjoy this book.Although the books can be enjoyed by non-Jews, I think if you don't know the basics of Judaism, you'll be missing the most vital part of the book.

The cat is a wonderful character, particularly when he is arguing theology and Talmud. I suspect if cats really could talk and argue theology, they'd act much like the one drawn in this book. In fact the book was inspired by the author's real cat (who doesn't speak, at least that I know of :-)) but apparently does understand how to keep his humans.This book can be enjoyed on several levels - as a fable about a cat and his humans, as a series of theological and philosophical debates, or just as a fun story about a talking cat and his adventures with his master.An important story element about midway through that the cat never figures out, but my wife did - it is an exchange, not a loss. This will make more sense after you've finished the book.One does not have to be Jewish or a scholar to appreciate the story and humor, but we gave a copy to our Rabbi as a gift and he loved it too.

The cat is one of the most charming, insightful, and funny characters to appear since Philip Roth's more audacious characters. This book is both laugh-out-loud funny, sad, sardonic, and ultimately life-affirming. It is an extremely offbeat book - trying to describe it is almost impossible. You really have to see it to ""get"" it. Unfortunately, no preview pages appear on the site, because that would greatly help to convey the character of the book.To give you an idea: in the first section, the cat eats a parrot and gains the power of speech. He explores all of the things one can do with that: taunt, lie, blaspheme, and bait. The rabbi wants to teach him Torah, but he wants to learn Kabalah. The issue is brought to ""the rabbi's rabbi,"" where the cat informs him that:""I want to convert to Judaism. He asks me why.I tell him that if I am a good Jew, the rabbi will let me spend time with his daughter.I explain to him that the rabbi's daughter is my mistress.That I can't live without her, because she is my joy, and love is a beautiful thing.He tells me that my motives for converting to Judaism are unsatisfactory, that my love of God isn't sincere.I never said anything about love of God....He says that thinking of God fills even the grayest days with sunlight. He says that the love of God should be almost carnal. He tells me that it is an intellectual love but you should always feel as though you were cradled in the arms of a master who is invincible, benevolent, and just.I tell him that this is exactly what I feel for my mistress. ...I answer that he blasphemes, that my mistress is true.He says that only God is true.I say that God is a reassuring myth. I say that he doesn't have anyone to take care of him because he is old and his parents are dead.I say that I have my mistress and I will never be alone because I will die before she does. He throws my master and me out.""Couple dialog like this with the wonderful drawings, the cat's flashing green naughty eyes, the gentle rabbi and his beloved daughter, and you have an amazingly odd, touching, and engaging book.Be advised: this is not a children's book (although if you are liberal with your older children and don't mind them dealing with some adult themes, I'm sure a lot would love it). The themes are theology, faith, death, existential fear, love, religion versus secularity, jealousy, and even class differences in France. Don't be put off though; it's an easy, fun, and quick read. Sfar is immensely talented, and the sparse prose has been carefully thought out and apparently translates well. Don't miss this one!"	R

I feel that the main theme of this work is summed up in one panel, when the rabbi says, ""Blessed are thou, who allows us to transgress.""There is an underlying theme of bitterness in this book; the rabbi is widowed; the cat wants to become a bar-mitzvah, Paris has changed the rabbi's family, and the wonderful singer can only find work as a clown.The main story is that of a cat narrating the events in the lives of his owners, a rabbi and his daughter. When the cat eats a parrot, he gains the power of speech, only to lose it when he wants to break one of the ten commandments.There is a lot of religious details the author has provided, but for some reason he left out one rabbinic tradition, that of a wife cutting her hair when she marries.Another theme is the role ignorance of Kabbalah and Talmud play in religious circles.In summary, this book is a wonderful tale, but not meant for kids, due to some of the translated language."

They usually give me headaches, but this one revealed a quirky style and a refreshing lack of onomatopoeia in starbursts. It's so much easier to tell a good story when you're not constantly being interrupted by POW!! and ZOK!!! and the like.As a cat owner, I confess that it was the title that grabbed my attention, but I'm guessing that the plurality of cat lovers will not like the way the cat is drawn: Sfar's style sometimes reminds me a bit of Ralph Steadman's, and the cat's proportions change according to his mood and the context of the scene. Sfar focuses on intriguing details--a character might be drawn very sketchily in one scene, but some small object in the background will be meticulously rendered. In the next scene, the same character will fill the frame and be drawn with equal attention. This style works out perfectly for as mutable a creature as a cat.Format and style aside, the story is what really made me buy this book. The prose works just as it should with the illustrations, an aspect that I think some graphic novelists overwork, or ignore. As a fan of Issac Bashevis Singer, I was sucked in when the rabbi's initial response to his talking cat was ""Will he be a Jew?"" And, more importantly, ""Will he be a good Jew?"" (Not being Jewish, by the way, has not been an obstacle to enjoying the work of either author.)The book is divided into three separate stories, and while the first was my favorite, I also enjoyed following the cat and his rabbi as their family circle expanded to include an exotic friend with a lion (who gets along amiably with the cat) and a down-on-his-luck singer who has been reduced to belting out bawdy numbers on Sabbat.Like the very popular ""Persepolis"", this book has shown that graphic novels can be both funny and deep, and that they deserve to share shelves with the best non-graphic novels of our time."

What makes this graphic novel really great is the way that Sfar is able to weave very subtle everyday elements of life into his stories. The characters' emotions, particularly the rabbi and the cat have such great range and believeablity... many Western comics artists should take note.Indeed, its a welcome break from the white-boy 'slice of life' comics that are so trendy in comics now.

The cat gains the ability to speak by swallowing the family parrot, an act that he, of course, immediately denies. The conversations between the cat, the rabbi, and the ""rabbi's rabbi"" are some of the funniest parts of the book, but along with such questions as whether the cat should be considered Jewish or whether his age (for bar mitzvah purposes) should be calculated in human or ""cat"" years, is some serious and wide-ranging philosophical and theological discussion. What is a Jew? What does it mean to be created ""in God's image""? What is the difference between the cat's feeling for his mistress and the love of God? As a Reconstructionist I like the idea put forward by another reviewer of this being ""the first Reconstructionist cat."" And what other branch of Judaism would a cat choose?Eventually the cat pronounces the sacred name of God and loses his ability to speak, and from this point the book concentrates more on the relationships between human beings, although still from the cat's perspective. He experiences the pangs of jealousy when a young rabbi from an assimilated French family comes to their town and falls in love with his young mistress . He and his master then travel with the young couple to Paris to meet the groom's family, and must adjust to a very different kind of Jewish life before they return home to Algeria. On their journey they encounter several delightful minor characters, from the rabbi's cousin Malkah of the Lions (and his pet lion) to a cabaret singer in Paris.The Rabbi's Cat can be read on several different levels - as an entertaining ""talking animal"" story, an affectionate portrait of Sephardic Jewish culture, or a complicated story of human (and animal-human) relationships.

Meet the first reconstructionist cat and rabbi from Algeria,"Safr's beautifully illustrated tale of a traditional rabbi who loses his faith in the face of colonial assimilation and a secular cat who tells the tale is on the level of Will Eisner's Contract With God and Art Speigelman's Maus. American readers will certainly connect to the tale as an Algerian parallel to the intellectual journey of Mordecai Kaplan, the American Jewish thinker whose Judaism as a Civilization was penned at the same time of the setting of this fictional fable. Safr raises the ultimate post-Enlightenment question: What is the role of religion in the absence of a supernatual God who acts in history?

""The Rabbi's Cat"" is a graphic novel set in Algeria in the mid 1930s. A poor rabbi lives with his lovely daughter Zlabya and their precocious gray cat. In over 850 marvelously-varied panels, author Joann Sfar tells the story of the trio as they deal with the cosmic questions of life, love, God's existence and fickle human nature. The story shuttles between sun-baked traditional North Africa and rain-drenched, cosmopolitan Paris. Sfar's palette ranges from the reds, oranges and yellows of the rabbi's home country to the muted blues, greens and whites of the Moroccan night and of the Parisian day.The book's characters are wonderful and complex. The old rabbi is kind, God-fearing and gentle, but fears being replaced by a more urban man who speaks French. His beautiful, young daughter, content to remain in her father's house, playing the piano and reading, also longs for love. The cat -- a cunning and shameless atheistic and opportunist -- gains speech, insists on being Bar Mitzvah and demands to learn the Kabala. He contends pointedly, if ignorantly, with the learned over theological questions -- all the while angling for a night on the prowl. There's also old and sinewy Malka of the Lions, striding manfully from the desert, toting an ancient rifle and accompanied by his faithful leonine companion. The book follows the characters through normal life events -- shopping, praying for the dead, washing dishes -- but touches on themes of death, hypocrisy, apostasy and man's relationship with a rather enigmatic and silent God. Using this humble cast, and in a medium not fully taken seriously by all, Sfar plumbs depths not normally plumbed by many serious works. Sfar's art is deceptively spare, but is always evocative and never dull. His message is one of optimism, delivered with humor and humanity.If this book were a film, I would rate it PG-13 for a small amount of nudity and vulgarity, and for the adult themes it explores."	R

The Rabbi's Cat	The Rabbi's Cat,16.93,A1RAUVCWYHTQI4,A. Ross,8/13,3.0,1177891200,Too Aimless for My Taste,"I've long been a fan of the graphic novel, and I picked this one up mainly on the strength of its Algerian setting. Parents should take note: despite its somewhat children's bookish cover and title, this book is definitely intended for an older audience (there are some four-letter words and nudity), and the somewhat rambling narrative may well not hold the attention of teens.The story starts in colonial Algiers sometime in the 1930s, where we meet a humble widowed Algerian rabbi, his beautiful daughter, and their scrawny cat. The first third of the book concerns itself mainly with the rabbi and the cat, who, after eating a parrot, gains the ability to speak. Before long, the cat wants to learn about Judaism and convert, and starts asking all kinds of thorny theological questions. This leads to a pretty funny debate with the rabbi's mentor -- all of does a nice job of capturing the disputative nature of Judaism. (Those with a background in Judaism may well get a lot more richness and texture from this storyline than non-Jews like me.)This promising storyline is abandoned when the cat loses its power of speech, and the middle section segues into a somewhat meandering account of the rabbi's need to pass a French test in order to remain rabbi and a visit by the rabbi's dashing rural cousin. While this does a reasonable job of depicting the indignities of colonialism, there's not much else to this section. The arrival of a thoroughly urbane young rabbi from Paris propels the final third, as the beautiful daughter falls in love with, and marries him. The married couple and Algerian rabbi then visit the husband's family in Paris (with the cat tagging along). There, the rabbi has trouble coping with the cultural differences, and goes on a little adventure to track down a musician nephew, leading to even further indignities.I can't say I found the book nearly as delightful as most others seem to. Despite the running theme of faith, the narrative is altogether too disjointed to my taste, and despite bursts of jollity, the entire tone seemed rather wistful. The artwork is similarly impressionistic, with forms ranging from realistic to exaggerated to surreal. The palate is quite nice, as the natural earth tones of Algeria contrast vividly with the oppressive dreary grays and blacks of Paris. At times the panels get a little crowded by text though, and the entire book is a bit 'wordier"" than your average graphic novel"	R

The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children."

Her story was heavily disputed by first the Secret Service who kept her in custody for hours on that fateful day, the CIA agent who was present in her first meeting with the FBI, and the FBI who interviewed her extensively for days after the assassination, as well as the Warren Commission's attorney who humiliated and intimidated her before taking her testimony for the Warren Commission.Some of the most interesting facts presented in this book are:1. Jean Hill saw Jack Ruby run at break-neck speed from the Texas Book Depository to the fence on the grassy knoll immediately after the shooting of JFK, as she ran towards the fence where she thought the shooter was.2. She saw a man in a Dallas-police uniform holding a rifle and standing behind the fence on the grassy knoll, immediately after the shooting, right before she was grabbed and escorted away by two Secret Service men.3. Her boyfriend was J.B. Marshall, the Dallas police officer who was on a motorcycle to the left rear of the president's car and who's helmet and bike got splattered with JFK's blood and brains. He told her that LBJ's Secret Service people instructed the motorcycle cops at the Dallas airport that these changes were being made: (a) the parade route was being changed to cut through Dealey Plaza on Elm Street; (b) the motorcycle cops would not be at the front of the presidential limousine as they normally would have been, but would only be at the rear of the presidential limousine; (c) the order of the cars in the motorcade was changed so that Johnson's car would not be immediately behind the presidential car, but that a carload of Secret Service would be in between the President's car and LBJ's car. Most shocking of all, was his report to Jean Hill that another motorcycle cop witnessed that LBJ started ducking down in his car at least 30 to 40 seconds before the first shots were fired.4. Arlen Specter, who questioned her in Dallas for the Warren Commission, was the one who proposed the &quot;single bullet theory&quot; that was adopted by the Warren Commission. His butchered transcript of her testimony to the Warren Commission was &quot;heavily edited, completely distorted and shamelessly fabricated.&quot;Author Bill Sloan does a credible job of telling Jean Hill's story and explaining her inner turmoil and emotional trauma about being a witness to the assassination. He explains about:1. Why she refused to go to Washington to testify before the Warren Commission.2. That she was romantically involved with a married man at the time (J.B. Marshall) and how he repeatedly tried to convince her to keep quiet about what she knew, and how he evidently knew more than he wanted to tell her.3. That the FBI kept her home under surveillance for 15 months after the assassination.4. Why she would not testify in the trial of Clay Shaw in New Orleans, although J.B. Marshall and Mary Moorman did.5. Her eventual vindication and validation through experiences with Bill Marrs (author of Crossfire) who introduced her to others who witnessed the assassination, and her experiences with Oliver Stone and Kevin Cossner during the filming of the movie &quot;JFK.&quot;6. The details of the attempts on her life (most significantly, one almost-fatal car wreck caused by the steering-wheel bolts being unscrewed and another time when her car's brake-fluid line was found to be cut).The most inexplicable fact about Jean Hill's story is why was Jack Ruby running at break-neck speed towards the shooter behind the fence on the grassy knoll? She did not know who Jack Ruby was until she saw him on tv, as he shot Oswald. Her fear that no one would believe her about seeing Ruby running towards one of the shooters was increased when she was told by FBI agent Shanklin that eye witnesses had proved that Ruby was not at Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination. Perhaps her identification of Ruby at Dealey Plaza is the clue to why her testimony was distorted by the Warren Commission, why she was intimidated and humiliated, and why her story is so important. No doubt, historians, researchers, and future generations interested in finding out the truth about the JFK assassination will be grateful that Jean Hill's story is finally available in this book, published twenty-nine years after the assassination, without any distortion by those who would have preferred that it had never been told."
