Vector Quantization and Signal Compression  The Springer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science,Herb Caen  a popular columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle  recently quoted a Voice of America press release as saying that it was reorganizing in order to  eliminate duplication and redundancy    This quote both states a goal of data compression and illustrates its common need  the removal of duplication  or redundancy  can provide a more efficient representation of data and the quoted phrase is itself a candidate for such surgery  Not only can the number of words in the quote be reduced without losing informa tion  but the statement would actually be enhanced by such compression since it will no longer exemplify the wrong that the policy is supposed to correct  Here compression can streamline the phrase and minimize the em barassment while improving the English style  Compression in general is intended to provide efficient representations of data while preserving the essential information contained in the data  This book is devoted to the theory and practice of signal compression  i  e    data compression applied to signals such as speech  audio  images  and video signals  excluding other data types such as financial data or general purpose computer data   The emphasis is on the conversion of analog waveforms into efficient digital representations and on the compression of digital information into the fewest possible bits  Both operations should yield the highest possible reconstruction fidelity subject to constraints on the bit rate and implementation complexity,Allen Gersho    Robert M  Gray,Springer Science   Business Media,2012 12 06,Technology   Engineering
