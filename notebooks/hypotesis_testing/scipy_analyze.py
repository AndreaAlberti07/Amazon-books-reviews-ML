# Definition of a function to calculate many statistics of a given dataset
def scipy_analize(variable_1, varname_1, variable_2, varname_2, analysis_list):
    """
    This function takes two variables and performs the following analysis:
    1. Check if the data are normally distributed
    2. Check the correlation between the two variables
    3. Check if the two variables follow same distribution
    4. Check if the two variables are independent
    5. Check if the mean of the two variables are equal using Wilcoxon
    
    Parameters:
    variable_1: data (i.e. list, array, series, etc.)
    varname_1: string (name of the variable)
    variable_2: data (i.e. list, array, series, etc.)
    varname_2: string (name of the variable)
    analysis_list: list of integers (1-5) to indicate which analysis to perform
    
    Returns:
    None
