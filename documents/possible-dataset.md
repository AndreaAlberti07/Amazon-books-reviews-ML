# This is a list of possible dataset

- NLP:

  - [Amazon Books Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews)
    <details>
      <summary markdown="span">Davide comments</summary>

    - There are a lot of informations about the reviews and books,
          so there are a lot of possible hypotesis.

    - Easy to analyse data

    - Approved

    </details>

  - [Amazon reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritanjalijain/amazon-reviews)
    <details>
      <summary markdown="span">Davide comments</summary>

    - Contains only title and description of the review, we can only
      perform sentiment analysis

    - Limited hypotesis

    - It could be too difficult to process

    - But it's a real NLP dataset

    - Approved if we would perform NLP analysis
